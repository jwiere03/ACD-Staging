<h3 dir="ltr">Need an Allegan County Criminal Attorney?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Kronzek Firm attorneys have been defending criminal cases throughout Michigan for almost two decades.  We have a professional team of highly successful trial attorneys in Allegan available to help you with your case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’ve recently been arrested or charged in Allegan County, you need to know who you can talk to and who you should avoid. Once the police have tagged you as a suspect, they’re no longer your friends -- and talking to them may only give them more material that they can use against you in court. Police often make offers and promises that they don’t have the authority to back up. When you’re facing a police investigation, the first and sometimes the only person you should be talking to  is your attorney.</p>

We provide our clients with clear and effective legal advice and aggressive representation.
