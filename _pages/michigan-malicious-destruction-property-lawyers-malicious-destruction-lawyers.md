&nbsp;
<h3>About Malicious Destruction Prosecutions:</h3>
Malicious destruction of property is a crime which alleges that a person willfully and maliciously destroys property owned by another.  This encompasses a wide range of property, but the most commonly focused aspect is the destruction of personal property.

&nbsp;
<h3>What are the penalties for Malicious Destruction?</h3>
If the amount of the injury or destruction is $20,000.00 or more, or the amount is $1,000.00 to $20,000.00 plus two or more prior convictions, then this is felony with the maximum penalty up to 10 years in prison, a fine up to $15,000.00, or 3 times the amount of the injury or destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

If the amount of the injury or destruction is $1,000.00 to $20,000.00, or the amount is $200.00 to $1,000.00 plus one or more prior convictions, then this is a felony with a maximum penalty up to 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or 3 times the amount of the injury or destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

If the amount of the injury or destruction is $200.00 to $1,000.00, or the amount is less than $200.00 plus one or more prior conviction, then this is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty up to 1 year in jail, a fine up to $2,000.00, or 3 times the amount of the injury or destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

If the amount of the injury or destruction is less than $200.00, then this is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or 3 times the amount of the injury or destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

The amounts of the destruction may be aggregated over a 12-month period. So for instance, if a person goes on a spree destroying cars in various parking lots over a period of a few weeks, the total value of the damage may be added together. Another example might be if a person drives down a road knocking over every mailbox in his or her path. The total value of damaged property would be added together over that time frame.

&nbsp;

If convicted, the court may  order <a title="Michigan Restitution Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/restitution.html">restitution</a> be paid to the victim for the value of the destroyed property, either for repairs or replacement. This includes juveniles who destroy property as well.

&nbsp;
<h3>Malicious Destruction of a Barn, House, or other Building</h3>
Willful and malicious destruction of certain buildings or appurtenances is prohibited as well. If the amount of the destruction to the house, barn, or building is $20,000.00 or more, or if the value is $1,000.00 to $20,000.00 plus 2 or more prior convictions, then this is a felony with a maximum penalty up to 10 years in prison, a fine up to $15,000.00, or 3 times the value of the destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

If the amount of the destruction is $1,000.00 to $20,000.00, or if the value is $200.00 to $1,000.00 plus one or more prior convictions, then this is a felony with a maximum penalty up to 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or 3 times the amount of the destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

If the amount of the destruction is $200.00 to $1,000.00, or the value is less than $200.00 plus one or more prior convictions, then this is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty up to1 year in jail, a fine up to $2,000.00, or 3 times the amount of the destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

If the amount of the destruction is less than $200.00, then this is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or 3 times the amount of the destruction, whichever is greater, or both.

&nbsp;

The amounts of destruction may be aggregated over a 12-month period as well to determine the total value of damage.
