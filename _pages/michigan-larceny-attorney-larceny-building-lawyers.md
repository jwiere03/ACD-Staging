<h3>Michigan Larceny Defense Team</h3>
Do you need help with a larceny charge?  The trial team at The Kronzek Firm PLC, has a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html">consistent track record</a> of successfully defending a wide range of property crimes. If you have been accused of stealing from a building, or any other type of theft or larceny crime, it is essential to obtain aggressive and experienced attorneys that will not only defend your rights but also protect you from overzealous prosecutors. We understand larceny cases and know how to build strong legal strategies that work for our clients.
<h2><b>What is Larceny from a Building?</b></h2>
A larceny of a building is when a person steals from a house, house trailer, store, office, gas station, warehouse, shop, factory, mill, hotel, school, barn, or basically any public building.  In addition, a breaking and entering into the building is not required.

This offense is a felony with a maximum penalty of 4 years in prison.
<h3>What if the Building was Vacant?</h3>
Stealing from a vacant building is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of one year in jail or a fine up to $1,000.00. This includes breaking into vacant buildings that may be under construction and taking or damaging fixtures.
<h3><b>Our Approach to Defending Larceny from a Building Charges</b></h3>
At The Kronzek Firm PLC, we  believe that every accused person has constitutional rights that need to be protected.  These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Miranda Rights</li>
 	<li>4th Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure.</li>
 	<li>The Right to Counsel</li>
 	<li>The Right to Due Process</li>
 	<li>The Presumption of Innocense</li>
 	<li>The Right to Remain Silent</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, the police have often trampled on our client's rights before we got involved.    Often times, we can take this unfortunate fact and use it for our client's advantage.

Therefore, we roll up our sleeves and work with you—not just for you—to fight unjust charges and to get you the kind of outcome you want.
