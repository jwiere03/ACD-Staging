<h3><b>What is forgery?</b></h3>
This crime involves falsely making, forging, altering, or counterfeiting bank bills or promissory notes with the intent to defraud. This is classified as a felony with a maximum penalty of 7 years in prison. To be convicted of this crime, a person does not even need to use the forged check.  Simply creating it with the intent to commit fraud is enough.    Of course, as a practical matter, most prosecutions involve a  person who is actually accused of passing the forged instrument.
<h3>Other types of Forgery</h3>
Forgery of notes, bonds, certificates, warrants, or other instruments issued by the state treasurer or an authorized person with the intent to defraud others is also a felony with a maximum penalty of 7 years in prison.

Forging or counterfeiting a public record, certificate, return, or an attestation of a court clerk, notary public, or public officer where the item may be received as legal proof or provides a host of other functions—with the intent to defraud—has a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

Furthermore, forgery related to a deed, mortgage discharge, a letter or power of attorney, or other document that affects interests in real property is also a felony with the same 14 year penalty.

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that forgery is the type of offense in which federal charges may arise as well.
