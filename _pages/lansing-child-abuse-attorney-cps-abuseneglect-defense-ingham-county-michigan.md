<h2>Lansing, MI - Best Child Abuse Defense</h2>
What do you do when you need an excellent Lansing child abuse attorney?  Turn to the Experts!  The Kronzek Firm attorneys have distinguished themselves as experts in the field of child abuse defense.  We fight to keep families together.  We fight to uphold parental rights.  We fight to help clients avoid jail and avoid prison.
<h3>Lansing Child Abuse Cases can be Difficult to Defend</h3>
Child abuse and neglect cases are some of the most emotionally devastating cases for parents and caregivers to face.  It is often difficult to keep jury biases and even your judge's biases out of the courtroom.  If you think about it, this makes sense.  Everyone naturally gets upset when a child is injured.  Although this is a natural reaction, the bias is often directed at the parents.  Fortunately, there is no need to face this alone.  The Kronzek Firm PLC has excellent Lansing child abuse attorneys available to assist you.  Our Expert Child Abuse Defense Team offers premier level representation for parents and others accused of child abuse.  Whether you need a criminal defense or a CPS defense, out attorneys have extensive experience and can defend you.

Child abuse cases can present several legal problems at once.  CPS investigations, criminal prosecutions, and divorce proceedings have a way of all coming into play at once.  This means that you could be facing a Termination of Parental Rights Petition, a Custody dispute, and a criminal prosecution for child abuse all at the same time.  The cost of defending two or three cases at the same time can be enormous.  Fortunately, we have  the experience you need.  We have on our staff winning attorneys who are well equipped to deal with all of these problems.

Oftentimes, Children's Protective Services (CPS) is in the lead on an investigation.  Keep in mind that they can, and will, share all of their investigation materials with police and prosecutors.  Don't make the mistake of talking to CPS without consulting a good trial lawyer first.  If you have already been talking to CPS, <strong>stop</strong>!  Call us before you help them anymore!
