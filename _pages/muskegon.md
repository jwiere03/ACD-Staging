<h2>Muskegon County Defense Team:</h2>
Have you been accused of or are you concerned about being accused of a felony or misdemeanor in Muskegon County? At The Kronzek Firm PLC, we work with Muskegon County criminal clients and clients across Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. We can help you understand the Muskegon legal system.
<h3>Are you Accused of a Crime?</h3>
In the face of accusations of property crimes, vehicle crimes, drug crimes, sex crimes, white collar crimes, or crimes against people we can bring our extensive legal experience to your case. Our attorneys are familiar with Muskegon County’s 14th Circuit Court and 60th District Court. We have successfully defended cases in this county for many years. You need more than an attorney who knows the law, you need an attorney who can guide you through this challenging time and who will scrutinize every detail of your situation, including a careful review of the police investigation and witness testimony. Building a viable defense should be a team effort.
<h3>How We Will Defend You</h3>
We believe in a partnership between our litigation team, a client and his friends, family and support group. We believe that you deserve the personal attention of your attorneys. If you have an attorney that shows up for court unprepared, you usually will not fare well. Likewise, if you can’t get your attorney to answer your calls or sit down to discuss your case, that is not a good sign. The time pressure on court appointed attorneys makes it hard for them to give client’s the attention they deserve. That is why we don’t handle any court appointed work absent some special circumstance. For nearly two decades, our attorneys have been aggressively and successfully defending criminal and child abuse/neglect cases. We can offer you a high quality defense and a positive relationship with your attorneys. <img style="float: right; padding: 20px 0 20px 20px;" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/images/county-img8.jpg" alt="" />
