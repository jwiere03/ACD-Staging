<h2>Expert Michigan Extortion Defense</h2>
The Kronzek Firm’s team of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html">seasoned criminal defense attorneys</a> has experience with defending, trying, and winning extortion cases in Michigan.  In most instances, extortion is charged by prosecutors along with other serious crimes.  However, extortion itself is a serious felony and can lead to a lengthy prison sentence of up to 20 years and staggering fines. Typically, there is an allegation that a threat was made during or after the commission of another crime.   An extortion charge must be <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html">defended well</a> or the consequences can be enormous.
<h3>The Crime of Extortion</h3>
Generally speaking, extortion is when a person aims for some kind of financial gain by using threats in order to get it. This offense tends to involve a threat of future harm as opposed to immediate harm like with robbery.

At trial, the prosecutor must prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction to result.
<ul>
 	<li>That there is a malicious spoken or written threat.</li>
 	<li>Next, that the defendant threatened to injure the target, his or her close family members, or property.</li>
 	<li>The threat must be made to gain money or financial advantage in some way.</li>
 	<li>That the threat is intended to force another person to act or not act in a way that is against his or her will.</li>
</ul>
This crime is completed when the defendant makes the threat with the intent to force the other person to comply.
