<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Eaton5.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-7308 size-medium" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Eaton5-300x169.jpg" alt="Eaton County Sheriff" width="300" height="169" /></a>Until you have professional legal representation, it is our advice that you not discuss any aspect of your case with the police, or with any caseworkers from other government agencies. We advise that you don't deny anything, don't proclaim your innocence, and don't answer any questions. Be polite and courteous, but until your attorney is present, you should refuse to discuss any aspect of the case. Remaining silent is a right afforded to you by the law. We also suggest that you not discuss any part of your case with your friends or relatives. Even if they openly support you and refuse to accept the allegations made against you. We understand the need to explain your side of the story, or earn their sympathy by denouncing the charges. But don't, under any circumstances, give in to this urge. Silence is the best possible option for now. Words can be twisted by prosecutors and people can be forced to testify against you in court.

As attorneys we have many years of experience defending clients against a wide variety of charges, including but not limited to: <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank">Armed Robbery</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-arson-attorney.html" target="_blank">Arson</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">Assault</a>, Burglary, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank">Drug Related charges</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank">Embezzlement</a>, Fraud, Larceny, Murder and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank">Rape</a>.

Don't put your future in the hands of someone who isn't invested in defending your rights and protecting you against criminal charges. You need the best, which is why you need us. This is a very difficult time, we understand that. So let us help you, and together we can work towards restoring your good name; salvaging a future for you and your family.

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Eaton County Lawyers Defend The Falsely Accused</strong></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is more terrifying than being accused of a crime you didn't commit. As if the damage to your reputation and the potential for criminal charges aren't frightening enough, there is the issue of cost. We aren't just talking about the financial cost, although that may well be substantial as well, we are talking about the cost to your future, freedom, and family.</span>



<span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Kronzek Firm, we believe passionately in our duty to defend the falsely accused, and those who have been treated unfairly by authorities. As attorneys we provide a strong, aggressive defense for every client, working together to develop creative and unique strategies that focus on a positive outcome. You don't have to do this alone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, as attorneys, we have great faith in our country's justice system, the truth is that wrongful convictions happen more often than people realize. According to the law, an individual who is accused of a crime is "innocent until proven guilty", but there are unfortunately instances where that sometimes just isn't true. But don't lose hope. We are here for you.
