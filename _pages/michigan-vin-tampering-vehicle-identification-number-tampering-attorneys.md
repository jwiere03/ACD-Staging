<h3><b>What is a VIN?</b></h3>
The automotive industry uses a vehicle identification number—usually abbreviated as VIN—to identify different types of motor vehicles. This number is a unique code including a serial number which identifies an specific automobile.
<h3><b>What is concealing or misrepresenting the identity of a motor vehicle?</b></h3>
<h4>Misdemeanor VIN Tampering</h4>
If a person conceals, misrepresents, or removes a manufacturer’s serial number without the intent to mislead others about the identity of a vehicle, then he or she may be charged with a misdemeanor.
<h4>Felony VIN Tampering</h4>
When a person intends to mislead another about the identity of a vehicle or a part of it and removes or defaces the manufacturer serial number or replaces the part as result, this is classified as a felony.  A conviction carries a maximum penalty of 4 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or both. For licensed dealers or repair facility, its licensed would be revoked.  If the individual committing the act is a licensed dealer, then the dealer’s license will be revoked.

Regarding any prosecution for this crime, possession of a vehicle or mechanical device where the manufacturer’s serial number or engine number is defaced, removed, replaced, or altered is considered evidence of proof of a violation.

In such cases where the identifying information has been removed and the identity of the car or device cannot be determined, the item is subject to confiscation by the state to be sold at public auction, put to government use, or turned into scrap. If the goods are taken from a licensed vehicle dealer, that dealer’s license will be subject to revocation.

In addition, it is prohibited to buy, possess, deliver, or to offer to buy, sell, or exchange any vehicle identification number (VIN) plate, antitheft label, federal safety certification label, secretary of state (SOS) vehicle identification label, posident die stamps, rosette rivets, or any copies of such. However, this does not apply to vehicle manufacturers, vehicle part suppliers to manufacturers, or law enforcement officers as part of their official duties.

A person cannot receive, buy, or obtain a motor vehicle or related parts with intent to buy, sell, or dispose of the items knowing that the identification numbers have been removed, tampered with, or altered. Yet, this does not apply if the vehicle is obtained from or at the direction of a police agency. Individuals in violation may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine up to $20,000.00, or both.
