<div class="county-lis">Are you looking for an aggressive Midland Criminal Attorney to help you with your case?  Our seasoned criminal defense team can help.  If you are facing serious criminal charges in Midland County, Michigan,  you need to get legal representation as soon as possible. The attorneys at The Kronzek Firm PLC have been defending criminal cases for the better part of two decades and have achieved many <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results" target="_blank">excellent results</a> for our clients.  These include not guilty verdicts, reduced charges, no jail sentences, no SORA sentences, expunged records and dismissals.</div>
<h2>Midland Criminal Defense Lawyers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Drug Cases - If you are facing drug charges, you will need an attorney who knows how to defend your constitutional rights.  Some of the most horrific violations that we see come in drug related cases.  You should not talk to the police unless <em>and until</em> you have a good criminal defense attorney on your side.</li>
	<li>Sex Crime Cases - We defend and win sex crime prosecutions on a regular basis.  Michigan prisons are full of people who were falsely accused and then poorly represented.  Let's not let that happen to you.</li>
	<li>Assaultive Crimes - The strongest defense cases are often the "he said / she said" cases.  This is often the scenario with Domestic Violence, Felonious assault and Assault with Intent to Commit Great Bodily Harm or Murder.</li>
	<li>Fraud, Theft, Tax Evasion &amp; Embezzlement - Economic crimes are often poorly defended because attorneys lack the right combination of knowledge and skill.  We have helped many clients avoid the harsh sanctions that are available under Michigan law.</li>
</ul>
The costs of a criminal conviction can include years of incarceration, thousands of dollars, and irreparable damage to your reputation, career, and family. You can’t afford to pay such a high cost; you need the help of experienced and tough criminal defense attorneys to help you avoid it at all costs.
