<h1><b>What are Anabolic Steroids?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steroid” is generally used as a shortened term for drugs known as anabolic-androgen steroids (AAS) or, more commonly, anabolic steroids. Other names for anabolic steroids are: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumpers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gym Candy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arnolds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” “<em>Roids</em>,” “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stackers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight Trainers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steroids became a household word in the late 1990s. It was discovered then that professional baseball players were using steroid drugs. Many of those baseball players were severely reprimanded. If caught with anabolic steroids, you too could lose your job or, worse yet, be charged with a very serious drug crime by state or federal prosecutors. If you are facing any kind of drug crime involving anabolic steroids, you need an expert </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan drug lawyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your side. The Kronzek Firm has been defending clients in Michigan for nearly a quarter century. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>How do Anabolic Steroids Work?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anabolic steroids are drugs that imitate the effects of the male sex hormone called testosterone. Scientists first isolated steroids in the 1930s. They discovered that the drugs could intensify the size and strength of muscles, increase endurance, and shorten the time needed for recovery between workouts. Shortly after that, people began using steroids for strength training. It has been said that even Nazis used steroids to prepare for battle.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, anabolic steroids have seen widespread use from bodybuilders to everyday athletes, all hoping to gain strength and build muscle. However, those who choose to use anabolic steroids over an extended period of time may later experience heart disease, liver disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Other, more outwardly noticeable effects include early balding and severe acne. Men using steroids could also see growth of breast tissue, infertility, and testicular atrophy. Improper use of steroids can have significant adverse effects on the body and on the brain. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since anabolic steroids mimic the effects of testosterone, women who use steroids may see effects such as thicker body hair, a deepening of the voice, and loss of menstrual cycles. Steroids can even affect the fetus of a pregnant women; female fetuses run the chance of developing male features. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, adolescents too may experience negative side effects from the use of anabolic steroids. Teenagers may experience both hindered growth and early sexual development. One of the most broadcasted effects of steroid use is what is known as “Roid Rage,” which refers to the users’ increased state of  aggression, violence and hostility.  </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Can anabolic steroids be used legally in Michigan? </b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there are some legal uses of anabolic steroids. Doctors can prescribe these steroids for a wide range of illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer, erectile dysfunction, anemia, and osteoporosis. In fact, anabolic steroids are normally made in pharmaceutical labs and they are sometimes also used in veterinary medicine. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is estimated that 1% of the United States has abused steroids at one time or another. They typically do this by injecting the drug into their muscles, but some opt to take steroid pills or steroid cream. Regardless of how the steroid in introduced into the body, it can cause harm to both men and to women. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who use steroids have discovered different methods of maximizing the drug’s effectiveness. One such method is known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cycling</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is where users take steroids for a couple weeks or months, stop using for a period of time, then start up again. Another method, known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stacking,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occurs when users take several different types of anabolic steroids at once. A third method is called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pyramiding</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where users begin with just small doses, then gradually increase to their maximum level, then gradually decrease back down to a small dose again. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Steroids and Sports </b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anabolic steroid use is strictly banned in every major sporting organization including MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, WWE, UFC, FIFA and the International Olympic Committee. To enforce non-steroid policies, these organizations mandate steroid drug tests. Anabolic steroids can be detected in urine, blood, and hair. It is not just professional athletes that have been banned from steroid use – in Michigan, any student athlete is also forbidden from using steroids. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Steroid Laws in the United States </b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3><b>Possession of Anabolic Steroids under Federal Law </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anabolic steroids were classified as a Schedule 3 drug by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990. This means that using anabolic steroids non-medically is illegal. If you are caught with possession of steroids without a prescription, you could be charged with a federal drug crime. This would mean being jailed for up to a year or paying a fine of up to $1,000, or both. The situation gets worse if this is your second drug crime: you could be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> imprisoned for 15 days to 2 years or pay a fine of up to $2,500, or both. If this is your third drug crime, then the jail time is 90 days to 3 years, the fine is $5,000, or you may have to face both. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Manufacturing Anabolic Steroids under Federal Law </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steroid manufacture, distribution, and dispensation are all federal felony drug crimes. Possessing steroids with the intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense these steroids are all federal felony drug crimes as well. If you are charged with any of these crimes, you could face prison for up to 10 years, or even up to 15 years if your steroids have caused serious bodily harm or death to the steroid user. A defendant may also face a fine of $500,000 or up to $2,500,000 if the defendant is a business entity. If charged, you will be sentenced to supervised release for a period of two years in addition to prison time. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Second Offenses in Federal Court </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sentence could be even more severe if you have already had a felony drug crime conviction. If this is the case, you could go to prison for up to 20 years or up to 30 years if your steroids have caused serious bodily harm or death to the steroid user. Fines for business entity defendants range from $1,000,000 up to $5,000,000. Supervised release time increases to 4 years, still in addition to prison time. Your sentence could become harsher still if you distributed anabolic steroids to a minor, distributed steroids near a school or college, or employed a minor in a drug operation. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steroid abuse is not an issue that is taken lightly by police, prosecutors, and judges. These harsh punishments have been put in place to crack down on steroid possession, manufacture, distribution, and dispensation, as well as the intent of manufacture, distribution, and dispensation. If you are being charged with an anabolic steroid drug crime, you must contact a knowledgeable and experienced attorney immediately. </span>
