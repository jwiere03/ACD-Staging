<h2>MICHIGAN SEX CRIME TRIAL LAWYERS</h2>
Assault with Intent to Commit Criminal Sexual Contact is a crime less frequently charged than <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html">Criminal Sexual Conduct</a>. Fortunately, our Michigan sex crime defense attorneys are up to the task of defending this allegation.

When a person assaults another person with the intent to commit an unwanted sexual touching, this is known as assault with intent to commit CSC II. An assault is an attempt to engage in a battery or an illegal act that places another person in reasonable fear of an immediate battery.

For a conviction to result at trial, the prosecutor must prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt:
<ul>
 	<li>The defendant assaulted another person;</li>
 	<li>The defendant intended the assault for sexual gratification or arousal;</li>
 	<li>The defendant specifically intended to touch the victim’s breast, genital area, groin, inner thigh, buttock, or related clothing—or the defendant specifically intended to have the individual touch such an area on him or her (where actual contact is not necessary); and</li>
 	<li>There must be intent to act in a way that would constitute a statutory circumstance that would support a CSC II conviction, for example, the application of coercion or force.</li>
</ul>
Moreover, this offense varies from attempted CSC. For example, with attempted CSC, a defendant may have acted beyond mere preparation of the crime without actually assaulting another person. Lastly, the statute of limitations for this offense is up to 10 years after the incident, or by the alleged victim’s 21st birthday, whichever is later, allowing for one exception.
<h2>PENALTIES</h2>
This offense is a felony with a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison. Also, the sentencing judge may possibly opt for probation. Additionally, registration is required under the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html">Sex Offenders Registration Act</a>. This is Tier I offense if the alleged victim is 18 years old or older. Next, this is a Tier II offense if the alleged victim is age 13 up to 18. Lastly, this is a Tier III offense if the alleged victim is under 13 years old. Tier I offenders must register for 15 years, Tier II for 25 years, and Tier III for life, unless special requirements are met to get off the registry early.
