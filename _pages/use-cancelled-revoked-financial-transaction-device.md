<h2>Defenses</h2>
There are many ways to defend an FTD charge.  It is best to sit down with an attorney that you have confidence in and  decide on your defense strategies.  We have handled many of these cases and each one is different.  The facts of your case will affect which direction we head in.  The Kronzek Firm has handled financial crimes cases with amazing success.  We have avoided prison, avoided jail, defeated cases in pre-trial proceedings and won jury in front of the jury.  Once you retain us, we will formulate a viable defense strategy together.  You will have the benefit of working with a very skilled and accomplished defense team.
<h2 dir="ltr">Penalties</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Potential penalties are important.  Many people want this information and so we provide it here.  However, this section would only apply to your case if you were convicted of this crime.  We have many ways of improving your situation including winning at trial, obtaining no-jail agreements, settling the case for reduced charges or entering into one Michigan's special statutory deferral programs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having said that, here is Michigan's sentencing scheme, keep in mind that these are statutory maximums and may not indicate what you would actually serve.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the value of the services, goods, property, or items is less than $100.00, then the penalties are as follows:</p>
<p dir="ltr">For a first offense, an individual may be charged with a misdemeanor punishable with a maximum penalty of 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If there are 1 or more prior convictions under this section (or a substantially similar local ordinance), then a person may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 1 year in jail, a fine up to $1,000.00, or both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the value of the property, goods, services, or items is $100.00 to $500.00, then the penalties are as follows:</p>
<p dir="ltr">For a first or second offense, a person may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 1 year in jail, a fine up to $1,000.00, or 3 times the aggregate value of the goods, services, etc; whichever is greater, or both.</p>
