<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26358 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pills-14550_640-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" />On an increasing basis, Ecstasy is quickly becoming one of the more popular drugs right here in Michigan and in fact, all over the United States. Ecstacy is also referred to as Molly, MDMA, E, or X. Originally, Ecstasy was used by doctors during psychotherapy sessions. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the beginning of the 1980’s, Ecstasy became a commonly used recreational drug, used especially in dance clubs. Today, the drug continues to be associated with electronic dance music and rave parties. In 1985, the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) worked with Congress to make Ecstasy illegal. Still today, Ecstasy drug cases are prosecuted aggressively by state of Michigan prosecutors and by federal authorities. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>How does Ecstasy affect the body? </b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A user will begin to feel the effects of Ecstasy around thirty minutes after ingesting the drug. Users will feel the sensations of the drug for a few hours, then they will come down with fatigue. Ecstasy stays in the user’s system for a a long amount of time, so authorities are easily able to detect it through the user’s blood, plasma, urine, hair, saliva and sweat. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Molly” is a newer version of Ecstasy. It is currently popular at raves and electronic music events. Other street names for this more purified and higher quality version of Ecstasy are “Meow Meow” and “Drone.” More recently, Molly has been found mixed with other drugs like as Methylone, Pentedrone, MDPV, 4-MMC, 4-MEC and MePP. All of these other drugs are mixed in to mimic the effects of MDMA. Because illegal drug manufacturers are mixing Molly with so many other drugs, the very dangerous compounds and dosages vary from batch to batch. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26359 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/emergency-1137137_640-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" />What’s worse is that this means that Molly users don’t really know what they are getting and they may not know how much they can tolerate, what they can tolerate or how their body will react. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes Molly much more dangerous to take today and has led to numerous  deaths in Michigan. Molly effects the human brain and nervous system to cause euphoria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can also cause a rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, and body temperature regulation issues. In the worst cases, these dangerous mixtures cause psychosis, seizures, and intense panic attacks, including intense depression when the drugs wear off. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Ecstasy results in memory loss (seen in 70% of users), even for users who only experience the drug short-term. Still, Ecstasy users report temporary positive effects including self-acceptance, hyperactivity, lowered pain levels, increased awareness, and lessened aggression. Some experts believe that minimal use of Ecstasy isn’t dangerous. Other medical professionals believe it to be quite dangerous. In any evening, Michigan drug laws are harsh on Ecstasy use, Ecstasy possession, Ecstasy manufacture and Ecstasy delivery. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Penalty for Ecstasy Use </b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, Ecstasy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">carries the least harsh penalty of any Ecstasy-related drug crime. Still, Ecstasy use is a misdemeanor. If found guilty of Ecstasy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan, a person may face up to a year in jail, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Penalty for Possession of Ecstasy </b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, Ecstasy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">possession</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a felony crime. A person found guilty of Ecstasy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">possession</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.</span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Penalty for Delivery and Manufacture of Ecstasy</b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecstasy d</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">elivery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ecstasy manufacture, Ecstasy creation, or Ecstasy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">possession with the intent to manufacture, create, or deliver Ecstasy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are felonies in Michigan. These are the most serious Ecstasy crimes and could result in up to 20 years in prison, a fine of up to $25,000, or both. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Enhanced Penalties for Ecstasy Crimes </b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The possible penalties that we've listed above are the basic, statutory criminal laws relating to Ecstacy under Michigan law. But sometimes, there are instances where criminal penalties for Ecstasy crimes could be even more severe. Examples of these cases are: Ecstasy was delivered to a minor; Ecstasy delivery occurred at a school or within 1,000 feet of a school; Ecstasy manufacture took place within 500 feet of a house, business, school, park, or church; the offender has had one or more previous drug convictions. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Driver’s License Suspension for Ecstasy Convictions </b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People convicted of an Ecstasy crime will face revocation of their Michigan driving privileges, in addition to all of the other penalties discussed. This applies even if the offender wasn’t driving while committing the Ecstasy crime. If this is the offender’s first drug crime, they will face a six-month driver’s license suspension. If the offender has committed at least one other drug crime in the previous seven years, then they will face a year-long driver’s license suspension. On top of everything else, the offender will also have to pay fines to the State of Michigan. </span>

<h1><b>Michigan Ecstasy Attorneys </b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ecstasy related drug crimes that we talked about on this page pertain to Michigan drug laws. However, it is possible for an offender to face federal penalties for their Ecstasy drug crime. This means that an offender’s penalties could be significantly more harsh than what is discussed here. </span>

&nbsp;
