<span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Invasion, Burglary, and Breaking and Entering are often referred to as being one and the same. Under Michigan law, however, they're clearly defined as being distinct crimes, but are often interconnected. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26143 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/broken-1391025_1280-300x168.jpg" alt="a glass door with a big smash in it where someone tried to break in." width="300" height="168" />For example, In order for someone here in Michigan to be charged with Home Invasion, they must have committed the crime of Breaking and Entering. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for someone to be charged with Burglary, it must be proved that they either stole property, or intended to steal property during a Breaking and Entering. In other words, forcing their way into a place or space where they were not legally allowed to be.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to understand exactly how the law defines a crime, and what the punishment is likely to be for someone facing that specific charge, you'll need to understand what each one is. On this page we've provided a basic outline of statutory Home Invasion, Breaking, and Entering and Burglary, with links to additional information for you. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Breaking &amp; Entering</b></h3>
<b><img class="size-medium wp-image-26144 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/canstockphoto16897768-300x200.jpg" alt="two men in ski masks sneaking into a building to steal " width="300" height="200" />Breaking and Entering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (sometimes called "B and E") refers to the act of illegally entering a building, or staying in a building, with the intention of committing a crime. This charge does not include stealing or vandalizing property, because those are considered to be separate crimes.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, the term "Breaking" refers to opening or moving something, whether it's a house or a simple container, to gain access to something you don't legally have permission to access. "Entering", which follows breaking, is exactly what it sounds like - entering. This could mean reaching into the container you just opened, or even reaching your hand into a building that you just opened.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways in which a person can be charged with Breaking and Entering, depending on several factors. Some of these factors include whether or not there was a weapon involved, whether the property broken into into was a car, a house, or a storage unit, and whether or not the person stole property during the B &amp; E.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Home Invasion </b></h3>
<b>Home Invasion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan is divided into three categories, namely: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/home-invasion-1st-degree-michigan-home-invasion-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Degree Home Invasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/2nd-degree-home-invasion-michigan-second-degree-home-invasion-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Degree Home Invasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/home-invasion-1st-degree-michigan-home-invasion-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Degree Home Invasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26145 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burglar-1216195_1280-300x200.jpg" alt="a man with a gun entering a building" width="300" height="200" />All three are felonies, but each one refers to slightly different circumstances, and is punishable by varying numbers of years in prison.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our law states that for a person to be charged with Home Invasion in any of the three degrees, they must have committed the crime of Breaking and Entering. However, once the person is inside the building or structure without permission, what they do there determines whether they will face first, second or third degree Home Invasion charges.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, whether they have a weapon with them at the time, and whether they commit some other felony (like assault or larceny) will affect how they're charged. Additionally, their intention when they entered the property, and whether or not there was another person present who was lawfully there at the time, are other factors that play into which charge the prosecutor may choose to bring.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Burglary</b></h3>
<b><img class="size-medium wp-image-26147 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burglary-attorney-los-angeles-1259943_640-300x200.jpg" alt="silhoette of a burglar, with crime scene tape and the word &quot;Robbery&quot;" width="300" height="200" />Burglary</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to the act of illegally entering a building or dwelling without permission, and stealing, or trying to steal, property. It isn't necessary for a theft to have actually taken place for the prosecutor to charge someone of this crime. They only have to prove that the person committed the B &amp; E with the intention of stealing something, for this charge to apply.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What defines Burglary as different from Home Invasion or Breaking and Entering, is the intention. If the person intended to commit another crime, like stealing property, after having committed a home invasion or breaking and entering, this then becomes burglary. Even if the other, intended crime, never actually took place.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Other Related Crimes</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26146 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/canstockphoto18192391-300x200.jpg" alt="a man in a ski mask holding another man at gunpoint" width="300" height="200" />If a person enters an occupied building armed with a weapon, and steals or attempts to steal property by using the weapon to threaten someone, this could be charged as </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed Robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, If the person threatens someone with the weapon during the robbery, which could mean the simple act of pointing the gun at someone and threatening to shoot, this could result in </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felonious Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charges.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, when a person steals items from a building, store, house, gas station or any other public or private building that they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">had a right</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be inside, but not the right to remove items, this would be charged as </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-larceny-attorney-larceny-building-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larceny</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It isn't necessary for Breaking and Entering to have occurred in order for a person to be charged with Larceny.</span>
