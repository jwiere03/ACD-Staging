<b>What is a felony?</b>
In Michigan, a felony is any crime that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, or any other crime that the law has designated to be a felony. This is compared to misdemeanor crimes, which are punishable by imprisonment for 1 year or less.

At The Kronzek Firm, we have over 80 combined years defending those accused of Michigan and federal felony crimes. Let us put that experience to work for you!
<h2>List of Answers to Questions That a Felon May Ask</h2>
<b>Can a felon own or possess a firearm?</b>
There are restrictions on a convicted felon possessing a firearm in Michigan. For the most part, if you have a felony record, you should not be in possession of a firearm unless you have reviewed both federal and state law with a knowledgeable attorney. Many Michigan residents have been arrested for felon in possession when they falsely believe that their <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html">firearm rights had been restored</a> after just the passing of time.

Keep in mind that the federal firearm rules are likely stricter than the Michigan gun laws, and it would be a good idea to hire an attorney to help with the restoration process. The attorneys at The Kronzek Firm can help you fight for restoration of your gun rights. We believe that everybody is entitled to use or possess a gun based on the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.

<b>Can a felon hunt?</b>
As you can see above, there are very strict rules when it comes to possessing a firearm if a person has been convicted of a felony. In most cases, bows and crossbows are okay for a felon to use for hunting. However, you should always consult with a knowledgeable attorney before purchasing or using any type of weapon for hunting.

<b>Can a felon vote?</b>
Each state regulates the voting rights of its citizens. In Michigan, people who are confined in jail or prison awaiting arraignment or trial are eligible to vote and register to vote, while people who are imprisoned during their period of confinement cannot vote or register to vote. However, when felons or other criminals are released from jail or prison after serving their sentence, they are free to vote without restriction.

<b>Can a felon get a passport?</b>
Most felons and other criminals can get a U.S. passport. However, passport applications may be denied for people who are imprisoned or on probation or parole for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html">certain drug offenses</a>, international <a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/">sex offenses</a>, or some other felonies and misdemeanors. Also, keep in mind that even if a person with a criminal record does obtain a U.S. passport, he or she is not guaranteed entry into other counties. For example, Canada routinely stops people from entering who have been convicted of a <a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/" target="_blank">DUI</a>.

<b>Can a felon join the military?</b>
Typically, a convicted felon cannot join any branch of the military. This includes the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, Air National Guard, and all other branches of the military. Each branch of the military has its own requirements regarding which crimes disqualify people from joining. In very rare instances, applicants can receive a waiver and get around these requirements.

<b>Certain professions</b>
Some professions—such as police officer, lawyer, doctor, and counselor—require that the applicants undergo background checks before they can become licensed with the state of Michigan. In most instances, a felony or misdemeanor conviction will stay on one’s criminal record for a lifetime, and this could disqualify someone from being licensed for their future profession.
