If you live in Ionia County and are facing charges following a CPS investigation, then you are going to need an excellent defense attorney on your side. Because being investigated by Child Protective Services is very serious, and facing charges for child abuse or neglect can throw your life into complete disarray.

That's where we come in. We are tireless, relentless, and fearless in our determination to defend our clients from the invasive and often bullying tactics used by Ionia County CPS workers. We have many years of experience fighting CPS, and are intimately familiar with the insidious ways that they sometimes conduct their investigations.

But unlike many attorneys, we are not afraid of CPS. We do not "tow the line" in child abuse cases, or allow the prosecutor to maneuver us into a corner. We are well known for the fact that we fight hard for our clients. Fight for their rights as parents, fight for their children's freedom, and fight for the futures of their families.

We have years of experience defending parents who have been unfairly charged and falsely accused by the State, and we are very good at what we do. We will work hard to defend your constitutional right to parent your children, and protect your rights from violation by overzealous agency workers.
<h2>False Allegations of Abuse by Ionia County CPS</h2>
Child Protective Services workers often get caught up in their own rhetoric. And with time, it can cloud their ability to see the truth. They begin to assume that every parent is an abuser. They vilify innocent parents, make horrible unfounded accusations, and tear families apart.

While the agency was put in place to protect children, the sad truth is that they often do more harm than good. Removing children from loving homes on the basis of lies and tearing families apart without fully investigating all of the facts. It can be devastating to lose a child, but even more so when the reason was never true to begin with.

As attorneys, we have seen the tragic consequences of lies. False accusations can destroy people. Ruining friendships, careers, and relationships. But it doesn't have to be that way. We have a long track record of success, both in the courtroom and out of it, and we know how to handle the types of lies you are up against.

As parents, we understand how frightening this must be for you. After all, nothing is more awful than being falsely accused of doing terrible things to a child, especially if the child in question is one of your own. But terrible as it may be, you don't have to face this alone. We are here for you.
