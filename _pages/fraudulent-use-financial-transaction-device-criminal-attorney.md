<h2>The Law on Fraudulent FTD Use</h2>
Michigan law prohibits an individual from <em>knowingly</em> and with intent to defraud using a financial transaction device to withdraw more money than the defendant had on deposit, or withdraw or transfer more money than the defendant was allowed, or withdraw money more often than the defendant was allowed.

If the amount of funds transferred or withdrawn is less than $200.00, then the person may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or 3 times the amount of funds withdrawn or transferred, whichever is greater, or both.

If the amount of the funds withdrawn or transferred is (a) $200.00 or more up to $1,000.00, or (b) the amount is less than $200.00 and there is one or more prior convictions under this section or a substantially similar local ordinance, then the person may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 1 year in jail, a fine up to $2,000.00, or 3 times the amount of funds withdrawn or transferred, whichever is greater, or both.

If the amount of the funds withdrawn or transferred is (a) $1,000.00 up to $20,000.00; or (b) $200.00 up to $1,000.00 and there is one or more prior convictions under this section, then the person may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or 3 times the amount of funds withdrawn or transferred, whichever is greater, or both.

If the amount of funds transferred or withdrawn is (a) $20,000.00 or more, or (b) the value is $1,000.00 up to $20,000.00 and there are two or more prior convictions under this section, then the person may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine up to $15,000.00, or 3 times the amount of funds withdrawn or transferred, whichever is greater, or both.

Lastly, the amounts of funds transferred or withdrawn in separate incidents as part of a course of conduct within any 12-month period may be added up to determine the total amount of funds.
