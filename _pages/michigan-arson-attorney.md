<h3><b>Expert Michigan Arson Defense</b></h3>
There are harsh penalties for the crime of arson in Michigan, even when the property destroyed belongs to the accused. If a Fire Marshall or arson investigator begins investigating a client’s case, we can be of assistance even before criminal charges have been filed.  Suspects should avoid being questioned by police without having legal representation present.  It is very important to protect an accused’s rights.

&nbsp;
<h3>The Role of an Insurance Company Arson Investigator</h3>
Today, most insurance companies have provisions which require the insured to fully cooperate with their investigation.  This can mean giving recorded and even sworn statements (interviews conducted under oath.)  Failure to cooperate may mean that your insurance claim will not get paid.  If you are being asked to cooperate with an insurance company arson investigation, you should have an attorney assist you.

In almost all instances, an insurance company investigator will share their information with the police or fire marshall.  In many instances, the insurance company will actually work alongside the police.  In those instances, talking to the insurance investigator is no different than talking to police, except that your Miranda rights don't apply.

<h3><b>What is Arson?</b></h3>
Generally, arson is a willful or malicious burning of property. There are three types of arson: Arson involving houses; arson involving other buildings or real property; and arson involving personal property.

This offense is also further distinguished between maliciously burning property just to cause damage or destroying property for financial gain.
