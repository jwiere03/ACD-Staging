<h1>Michigan Cocaine Defense Attorneys</h1>

You need an experienced, skilled, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/iStock_000013192259_Full.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-5007 size-medium" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/iStock_000013192259_Full-300x189.jpg" alt="Michigan Cocaine Lawyers" width="300" height="189" /></a>and aggressive Michigan criminal defense attorney to represent you if you have been charged with any Cocaine offense.</p>
There are two popular forms of Cocaine. The first form is a hydrochloride salt, which is a powdered salt that dissolves in water. This form of Cocaine can be injected with a needle into a user’s veins or it can be snorted up the nose or ingested by mouth. The second form is what is referred to as "freebase." The freebase form can be smoked.
<h1>Crack Cocaine</h1>
Crack Cocaine was developed as a lower-cost alternative to the pure freebase form. Crack Cocaine comes in a processed form of rock crystal that Crack Cocaine users heat in order to release the vapors. The name "Crack" comes from the cracking sound made when the rock crystals are being heated.

Cocaine is used by many people, regardless of age, social status, or religious beliefs. Some Cocaine users are young people who have money to spare. This has helped elevate Cocaine to a luxury "party drug" that people take before going out to clubs. However, people who cannot afford traditional Cocaine often use Crack Cocaine since it is easier to find in the inner-city and cheaper to buy. Cocaine is the second most popular drug in the United States (<a href="Marijuana.html">Marijuana</a> is the most popular). The United States is the world’s largest consumer of Cocaine.

Cocaine is considered a stimulant and not a narcotic. For many years, people wrongfully assumed Cocaine was a narcotic because the name of the law that banned Cocaine is the <a title="Harrison Narcotics Tax Act" href="https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Harrison_Narcotics_Tax_Act.html">Harrison Narcotics Tax Act.</a> Cocaine stimulates the nervous system. Cocaine users may experience alertness, elation, increased motor skills, a longer-lasting attention span, and feelings of sexual ability. However, users may also have a negative reaction to Cocaine, such as anxiety, restlessness, or convulsions.

Depending on the form of Cocaine and how the user ingests it, these sensations can last from fifteen minutes to one hour. Over time, Cocaine addiction develops and Cocaine users need higher doses more frequently in order to maintain their high. Cocaine can be detected in a user’s blood, plasma, and urine. People on probation are usually required to give urine samples to their probation officer to test for drug use. If the Cocaine drug test finds Cocaine in the probationer’s body, it can lead to a Michigan <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations">probation violation</a> charge.

Both federal drug laws and Michigan drug laws have become stricter as the government’s "War on Drugs” continues. Police, prosecutors, and the courts are not lenient with defendants who have been caught using Cocaine, possessing Cocaine, manufacturing Cocaine, creating Cocaine, or delivering Cocaine.

<h1>Michigan Cocaine Law and Penalties</h1>
<h3>Sentences for Cocaine Use</h3>

<h3>Sentences for Cocaine Possession</h3>
Cocaine possession is a felony drug crime in Michigan. If you are convicted of possessing Cocaine, your punishment depends on the amount of cocaine you possessed:
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">• If you possessed less than 50 grams of Cocaine, you could go to prison for up to <b>4 years, pay a fine of up to $25,000, or both</b>.

However, there are other factors that could make your sentence even more severe, and these include any prior criminal convictions and Cocaine crimes occurring in certain locations or involving a minor.

&nbsp;
<h3>Loss of Driver's License due to Cocaine</h3>
As with all drug convictions in Michigan, Cocaine convictions come with consequences to your driving privileges. This is true even when the offender was not driving at the time of the Cocaine offense. Conviction of Cocaine charges will also lead to the State of Michigan collecting fines from the offender to reinstate his or her driver’s license.

The Cocaine crimes discussed here are charged under the Michigan drug laws. It is also possible that a defendant could be charged for a Cocaine crime under local law or Federal law. You need a Michigan drug attorney who understands this and who has significant experience representing drug crimes.  Our attorneys handle cocaine cases in both the state and federal courts.

Defense of Cocaine cases requires a Michigan drug lawyer skilled at arguing violations of your Constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure. Drug cases often involve Fourth amendment violations and drug team police officers can be some of the worst violators of your rights. If you are charged with a Cocaine crime, you must have a competent Michigan <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html">drug crime attorney</a> working for you. Many Cocaine arrests in Michigan stem from illegal searches.

It is important that your lawyer know how to bring a viable defense to any drug charges.  At<strong> The </strong><b>Kronzek Firm</b>, we have successfully fought Cocaine charges all across Michigan.
