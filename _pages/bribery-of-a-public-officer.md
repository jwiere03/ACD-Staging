<h3>Michigan Bribery Defense Lawyers</h3>
The trial lawyers at The Kronzek Firm PLC, have extensive experience defending bribery and <a title="Extortion Defense" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-extortion-defense-attorney.html">extortion</a> charges. Our <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html">case results</a> speak volumes. Bribery is the voluntary giving of something of value to influence a public officer’s performance of official duties. Any individual who gives or offers to give any gift, money, gratuity, property or other valuable thing to any public officer, employee, or agent with the intent to influence the targeted individual’s actions, vote, decision, opinion, or handling of official matters or proceedings may be charged with a felony.
<h3>Public Officers Accepting Bribes</h3>
Any legislative , executive, or judicial officer who corruptly accepts any gift or gratuity—or any promise to make any gift to the officer under an agreement that:
<ul>
 	<li>An opinion, vote, judgment, or proceedings in his or her official capacity will be handled in any particular manner; or</li>
 	<li>That in such capacity he or she will make any particular appointment or nomination, will forfeit his or her office, and be disqualified forever from holding any public office, appointment, or trust in Michigan.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences For Accepting Bribes</h2>
The individual may be charged with a felony, with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, or by a fine up to $5,000.00. The key element of this offense is the presence of a corrupt intent—that at the time the money was received the recipient had the intent and purpose of acting in a way that is inconsistent with his or her official duties as a public officer.
<h3>Bribing Others</h3>
Also prohibited by law is the giving or offering of any gift or gratuity in exchange for influence in a decision or an opinion rendered by the following:
<ul>
 	<li>An appraiser;</li>
 	<li>Receiver;</li>
 	<li>Trustee;</li>
 	<li>Administrator;</li>
 	<li>Executor;</li>
 	<li>Commissioner;</li>
 	<li>Auditor;</li>
 	<li>Juror;</li>
 	<li>Arbitrator; or</li>
 	<li>Referee.</li>
</ul>
The person offering the bribe may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 4 years in prison, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both. If the violation occurs in a criminal case where the maximum term of imprisonment for the defendant is more than 10 years—or punishable by life in prison or any term of years—then the individual may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison, a fine up to $20,000.00, or both. Additionally , the person accepting the bribe may be charged with a felony as well.
<h3>Bribery of Officers of Public Institutions</h3>
Any individual interested either directly or indirectly in a contract with a municipal or state institution, and who corruptly gives, promises, or offers to any officer of said institution any gift, gratuity, or bribe with intent to improperly influence his or her action under the contract, may be charged with a felony.
