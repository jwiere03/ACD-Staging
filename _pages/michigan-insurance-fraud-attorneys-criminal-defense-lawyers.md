<h2><b>Michigan Insurance Fraud Defense</b></h2>
Insurance fraud prosecutions in Michigan come with the potential of severe sentences, including prison, jail, probation and stiff penalties.  If you are accused of engaging in insurance fraud, you can turn to highly skillful and experienced legal counsel at The Kronzek Firm.  Over the last two decades, we have developed a strong reputation for providing <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Proven-Results.html">positive results</a> for clients statewide.  Our attention to detail, and our courtroom tenacity have helped many clients obtain acquittals, dismissals and reduced charges.

A criminal prosecution for insurance fraud often begins with the insurance company rather than the police. If you are making a statement to an insurance investigator, you may be under investigation for fraud. It is best to review your situation with a knowledgeable attorney. Police will often share information with insurance investigators, so your statements to police and the insurance company will be compared to each other for discrepancies. Inconsistent statements about your claim is treated as a red flag and may lead to the filing of criminal charges and the rejection of your insurance claim. You can be prosecuted for the attempt to defraud an insurance company or the mere filing of a false insurance claim; so, it is not necessary that the claim was actually paid.
