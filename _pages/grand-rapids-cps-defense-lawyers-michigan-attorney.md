<h2>Defending CPS Cases in Grand Rapids</h2>
When Children's Protective Services Workers enter your life, it can be difficult and challenging to handle without help.  Fortunately, there is help available.  We have handled some extremely difficult cases in Kent County and throughout Michigan.  Our practice focuses largely on difficult to defend and medically complex CPS investigations.  Amongst our cases, we have tackled accusations like:
<ul>
	<li><a title="SBS Shaken Baby Syndrome" href="http://abuseandneglectdefense.com/michigan-shaken-baby-syndrome-sbs-defense-attorneys/" target="_blank">Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS)</a></li>
	<li>Abusive Head Trauma (AHT)</li>
	<li>Non-Accidental Injury (NAI)</li>
	<li>Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy (MSBP)</li>
	<li>Intentionally Inflicted Injury</li>
	<li>Medical Neglect</li>
	<li>Drug Addiction</li>
	<li>Methamphetamine Manufacturing</li>
	<li>Domestic Violence</li>
	<li>Educational Neglect</li>
	<li>Failure to Protect</li>
</ul>
We have been able to offer both hope and success to the vast majority of our clients.   Our approach to defending a CPS / DHS challenge is detail oriented, comprehensive and intense.  We find that being aggressive litigators who are not intimidated by CPS, Judges, or Prosecutors works well for our clients.

Ms. Thompson has won cases at every stage of proceedings including pre-file intervention, at the trial level, during the dispositional phase, and at termination trial.  Our clients are fortunate to have an attorney of her caliber.

His trial skill can be intimidating and he is highly respected amongst his peers.  His reputation as a tenacious litigator is extremely valuable to our clients.  Extensive knowledge of family law is vital for a Michigan CPS defense team.  This is because termination of parental rights trials require a judge to make determinations of the best interests of the children involved.  In Michigan child protection litigation, this is done by using essentially the same best interest factors that are used in a custody dispute.  Because of this, it is often a mistake to hire an exclusively criminal defense firm.  Many criminal defense attorneys do not understand child protection law.  Because of our diverse areas of expertise, The Kronzek Firm is able to draw on the litigation skill and knowledge of our family law attorneys when needed.
