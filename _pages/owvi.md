<h3>Operating While Visibly Impaired (OWVI)</h3>
<a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/operating-visibly-impaired-causing-serious-impairment-of-a-body-function-in-michigan.html" target="_blank">Operating While Visibly Impaired</a> (OWVI), or impaired driving, is one of the Michigan drunk driving laws. To convict a person of OWVI, or driving impaired, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, because of alcohol or drugs, a driver drove with less ability than would a reasonable driver. As <a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/attorneys.html" target="_blank">DUI defense lawyers</a>, our job is to prove that our clients charged with OWVI did not drive in an unreasonable manner or that any unsafe driving was not a result of any alcohol or drugs.

Often times, prosecutors will offer OWVI, or impaired, as a plea deal for a person charged with the main Michigan drunk driving crime: <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/owi.html">OWI</a>. An OWVI is a lesser-included offense of an OWI, meaning that if a person if found not guilty of OWI, he or she can still be found guilty of OWVI.

<h2>Michigan OWVI Penalties</h2>

The penalties for OWVI vary depending on whether it is a personâ€™s first, second, third, or subsequent drunk driving conviction. They also depend on whether the impaired driving caused the injury or death of another person. It is best to seek out a highly experienced drunk driving attorney if you have been charged with any drunk driving crime. Many years of experience, ongoing training, hundreds of cases, and extensive legal research make us a highly sought-after drunk driving defense team in Michigan.
