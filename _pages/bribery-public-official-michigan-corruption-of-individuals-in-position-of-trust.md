If this violation occurs in a criminal case where the maximum penalty for the defendant is (a) 10 years in prison, or (b) for life in prison or any term of years, then the person faces up to 10 years in prison, a fine up to $20,000.00, or both.
<h3><strong>Penalties for Accepting Bribes</strong></h3>
Any person summoned as a juror who corruptly receives anything to give his or her verdict, or corruptly receives a gratuity or gift from a party to any cause, suit, or proceeding to sway his or her decision in a trial verdict may be charged with a felony.
