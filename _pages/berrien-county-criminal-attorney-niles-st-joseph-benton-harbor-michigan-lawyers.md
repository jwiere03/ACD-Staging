<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20141110_154901.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5894" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20141110_154901-300x168.jpg" alt="Berrien County Sheriff Vehicle" width="300" height="168" /></a>If you've been charged with any major crime in Berrien County, you need to be aware of your rights and how to exercise them. The two most important ways that you can do this are by remaining silent and hiring a Berrien County Criminal Defense lawyer quickly. This means that you should not talk to the police about your case without first consulting with counsel. Instead, you should let them know that the only person you're willing to speak with is your attorney.

<h3><strong>Arrested in Berrien County, Michigan?</strong></h3>
If you have been arrested or charged with a crime, you should not face the system alone.<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20141110_154747.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-5898 size-medium" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20141110_154747-300x168.jpg" alt="Berrien County Sheriff Department and Jail" width="300" height="168" /></a>  Nor should you face the system with a court appointed attorney unless you have met the attorney and are confident that you are getting quality representation.  If you find yourself in the Berrien County Jail and facing serious felony charges, you will want to get a good attorney helping you immediately.  In the mean time, there are some basic things that you and your loved ones should know:
<ul>
	<li>All of your calls are being recorded, so do not discuss the case on the telephone.</li>
	<li>It is very common for other inmates to want to help themselves by helping the Sheriff and Prosecutor gain a conviction.  So, do not discuss anything about your case with other inmates, guards etc.</li>
	<li>Do not talk to a deputy, a detective or a polygraph examiner without first consulting with an attorney you have confidence in.</li>
</ul>
