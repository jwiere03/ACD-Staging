<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxycontin is a heavily regulated and controlled narcotic. It is prescribed to those experiencing moderate to severe pain, but the medication is similar in strength to morphine. The drug is meant for pain lasting an extended period of time and should not be used simply “as-needed.”</span>

&nbsp;
<h1 style="text-align: left;"><b>Obtaining Oxycontin </b></h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxycontin is often prescribed to people suffering from severe long term pain from back injuries, broken bones, neck (cervical) pain and kidney pain. Oxycontin is legal if you have a prescription, but otherwise it is illegal to possess, sell, manufacture, or consume it. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal prescriptions are given by doctors, but many people find ways to obtain Oxycontin without a prescription. One can steal, buy, or otherwise obtain it from someone who did have a legal prescription. One could steal the prescription pad from a physician and forge a prescription for Oxycontin. Other times, people will go “doctor shopping.” This is the practice of visiting several doctors until one finally gives in a writes the prescription for “Oxy”. This method could also result in receiving several prescriptions for Oxycontin. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxycontin is extremely addictive. Even those who take the drug for just a short amount of time risk becoming dependent. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<h1 style="text-align: left;"><b>Important Information about Oxycontin</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Oxycontin is such a potent drug, it should never be combined with any other pain medication. One should also avoid alcohol, tranquilizers, sedatives or other narcotic medications while on Oxycontin. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also very dangerous to take Oxycontin other than as directed. For example, one should never crush or break a slow-releasing Oxycontin tablet. Doing this could result in releasing an extremely high dosage of Oxycontin into the bloodstream all at once. Oxycontin should be swallowed whole. A large single dose can result in severe respiratory depression or even death.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Oxycontin overdose will result in symptoms including hives, swelling of the lips or face, seizure, difficultly breathing, convulsions, confusion/disorientation, lightheadedness, or severe drowsiness. If you or a loved one are showing any of these symptoms and have recently consumed Oxycontin, immediately contact 911, the paramedics, your doctor or call the Poison Help Line at 1-800-222-1222. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you have a legal prescription, Oxycontin is still a very dangerous drug. When you first start using it, you may see that your breathing has slowed or stopped. This can also happen when you change dosages. You should never consume more than prescribed or stay on the drug for longer than instructed. Overdosing on Oxycontin is often deadly. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have teenagers in your household, it is important that you keep track of your Oxycontin. A recent research study conducted by the American Society of Addiction Medicine has found that 1 in 30 high school seniors have abused Oxycontin.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h1 style="text-align: left;"><b>Oxycontin and Michigan Law</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Oxycontin has such high potential for abuse and addiction, it is considered a Schedule 2 drug under Michigan and Federal law. Drugs are classified as Schedule 2 when they have been approved for medical use in the US, but still must be heavily regulated because of their addictive properties. Michigan, therefore, only allows people to be in possession of Oxycontin if they have a legal prescription for the drug from a licensed physician. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are very serious penalties for anyone caught with illegally possessing Oxycontin. If you obtained Oxycontin through a prescription violation, you could face high fines and jail or prison time. However, the stakes are even higher when it comes to the use, possession, manufacture and delivery (sale) of Oxycontin. Outlined below are further penalties in regards to Oxycontin drug charges.</span></p>
