Providing excellent defenses against CPS, and allegations of abuse and neglect, for the parents of Caro, Vassar, Cass City, Fairgrove, Akron, Kingston, and Gagetown.
<h3>Michigan's Premier CPS Defense Team</h3>
You are up against something terrifying here. We know, because we have fought this battle before, many times, on behalf of other parents who have been right where you are now. Parents who were accused of terrible crimes against their own children. Parents who were labeled as abusers. Parents whose children were taken away from them.<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tuscola1-1-e1410453547194.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5372 alignright" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tuscola1-1-300x225.jpg" alt="Tuscola County Courthouse" width="300" height="225" /></a>

But you are not alone. Awful and frightening as this may feel right now, stressed as you may be, we can help you. The attorneys at The Kronzek Firm are Michigan's Premier CPS defense team. We have been doing this for years, long before any other defense firms in Michigan realized that false accusations by CPS were a very real and very common problem.

At The Kronzek Firm, we have decades of experience fighting to defend families against CPS and their bullying tactics. We know how they operate. We know what they are likely to say to coerce a "confession" out of you. We know what they will tell you in order to frighten you into saying what they want to hear. And we know how they twist what you say to suit their own agenda.
<h2>Child Abuse Penalties</h2>
<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tuscola-Sheriff4-e1410453637583.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5374 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tuscola-Sheriff4-300x225.jpg" alt="Tuscola Sheriff, Caro, MI" width="300" height="225" /></a>

As attorneys who specialize in fighting CPS, we have seen every imaginable scenario, and spoken to parents from all walks of life who are fighting frantically for their families. Parents who are losing, or have already lost, their children. It's terrifying. And you feel helpless. You feel afraid. Your family is being torn apart, and you are being accused of atrocious crimes. Your heart is breaking.

And as if that isn't bad enough, just think about the damage this could do to your reputation. From your neighbor's perspective, CPS might as well just put a sign on your front door labeling you a child abuser. You would be shunned, stared at, whispered about. It would be a nightmare, and you'd be trapped in the middle of it.

But it doesn't have to be like that. You don't have to do this alone. And in truth, you can't do this alone. Because regardless of how innocent you may be, false accusations can still do serious damage to your life. CPS is a massive agency, with considerably more resources at their disposal than you have at yours. And they tend to be taken at their word when they make accusations. After all, they are the "good guys," right? Wrong.

CPS, while they are very necessary in today's world, and they do very difficult work, are not always the good guys. In fact, the number of times that they've been wrong, that they've made a bad call, or passed judgment before checking their facts, has become the stuff of media legends.
<h3>Should I let CPS Interview my Children</h3>
Many people don't realize that if CPS is investigating you, the police may not be far behind. Although a CPS investigation and a criminal investigation are two completely different things, they can happen at the same time. And both could land you in serious trouble.

This is why it is critical to have an attorney that is familiar with the criminal court system and the family court system. Attorneys with both criminal and family law experience can represent you in both areas, and will be able to explain the ways in which your cases affect each other and overlap one another.

It is entirely possible for a person to be facing criminal charges for child abuse following a police investigation, and also be facing <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tuscola-DHS2-e1410453802388.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5375 alignright" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tuscola-DHS2-300x300.jpeg" alt="Tuscola CPS Office" width="300" height="300" /></a>a petition to terminate their parental rights following a CPS investigation. These two sets of proceedings are conducted in different courts and have very different consequences. But both of them can be devastating to your family if not handled properly.

Which is where we come in. At The Kronzek Firm, our attorneys are skilled at handling both criminal and family proceedings. We have the resources, the tenacity, and the fearlessness necessary to go head-to-head with CPS and the prosecutor's office. We can protect your rights, defend your case, and help you get the best possible outcome in your unique situation.
