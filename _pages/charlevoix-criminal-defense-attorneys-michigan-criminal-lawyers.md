Many people assume that answering the police’s questions will help their situation. However, in many cases, this is simply not true. Sheriff department investigators, CPS workers and Police officers are allowed to lie to and intimidate suspects in the hopes of forcing out information that could sabotage many defenses down the line. While it is a good idea to cooperate with police upon being arrested, you should not speak with them until you have an attorney present who knows how to fight for your freedom. Our attorneys have experience dealing with the Charlevoix police and legal system, where getting solid legal advice can mean the difference between freedom and imprisonment.
