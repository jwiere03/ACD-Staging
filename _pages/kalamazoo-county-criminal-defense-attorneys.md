<h4><strong>Have You Been Arrested in Kalamazoo County?</strong></h4>
As frightened and stressed out as you may be, there are a few things we would like you to remember right now. They're important, and might be the differe<img class="wp-image-5906 size-medium alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Kzoo3-300x168.jpg" alt="Kalamazoo County Courthouse" width="300" height="168" />nce between prison time and freedom in the future.

Until you have professional legal representation, it is our advice that you not discuss any aspect of your case with the police. Don't deny anything, don't proclaim your innocence, and don't answer any questions. Be polite and courteous, but refuse to discuss anything until your attorney is present. Remaining silent is a right afforded to you by the law. Use it.

We also suggest that you not discuss anything pertaining to your case with your friends or relatives. We know this is particularly hard, but it's critical that you keep silent, no matter how badly you want to explain your story, or elicit sympathy. Even if they openly support you, silence is still the best possible option. Words can be twisted by prosecutors, and people can be forced to testify against you in court.

As your attorneys, we would advise that you don't make any decisions regarding your case, or discuss any aspect of the case, without talking to us first. We want the best possible outcome for you. We have your best interests at the forefront of our minds from the moment you hire us to represent you, until the very last moment of your case.
