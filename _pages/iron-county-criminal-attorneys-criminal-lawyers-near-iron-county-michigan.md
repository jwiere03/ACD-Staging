<h2>Looking For an Iron County Criminal Attorney?</h2>
No one wants to get caught up in the criminal justice system. But when you find yourself in need of an Iron County criminal attorney,  there are three things that you need to do if you want to minimize the damage: keep calm, don't talk to the police, and call a criminal defense attorney right away. Many people don't realize just how important these three things are to making sure that their case has a fighting chance when it reaches criminal court.
<h3>Commitment to Excellence</h3>
The law firm of The Kronzek Firm PLC is committed to providing the citizens of Iron County with unsurpassed  representation for all their criminal law needs. Our team of Iron County criminal defense attorneys is second to none in their commitment to excellence in legal service.   <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html">See what we've been able to do for defendants all across Michigan</a>.
<h3>Commitment to Team Defense</h3>
Our vision of criminal defense is that we work on a team <em>with</em> a client and the people of his choosing.  We will bring our expertise to the table, and we will provide excellent courtroom representation.  We will also prepare your case to get the best possible result.  However, working with a client means that we will pay attention to your ideas and listen to your version of events.  We will offer you our thoughts after we listen to yours.  You will find that working with us is a different kind of interaction than you have experienced with other lawyers.
<h3>Commitment to Communication</h3>
Almost every day someone tells us that they are calling us because their other attorney won't take their calls.  We insist that all of our attorneys take all of their calls when available, return calls promptly when not available, and respond quickly to e-mails and letters.  We believe that the best results come in cases with good communication, good preparation and hard work.
<h3>It's Never to Late to Hire a Good Lawyer</h3>
We simply cannot stress enough the importance of having an experienced and reliable attorney at your side. Without a good attorney, you have no way of knowing what you're doing when you get to court. If you'd like to speak with one of our attorneys about your criminal matter in a free consultation, call our offices at 1-866-7NOJAIL or fill out our website's <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html">online contact form</a>.
