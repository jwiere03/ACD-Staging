<h4><strong>Help With Shiawassee County False Accusations</strong></h4>
False accusations are terrifying. Just the words are enough to give anyone a serious case of the willies. Unfortunately, many people make the mistake of assuming that false accusations happen only in movies, or to "bad people" who are probably "guilty of something.” This couldn't be further from the truth.

False accusations happen regularly, for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's because an accused person wants to cut a deal with police, and they think offering up another name may get them off the hook. On occasion it happens because someone wants revenge against someone else, and so they lie about them. Some of these reasons are legitimate mistakes. Honest misunderstandings. But most are the result of selfishness, nosiness, paranoia, and even vindictiveness.

At The Kronzek Firm we have a long history of working with falsely accused individuals in Shiawassee County and getting extremely successful results. We've seen them all, cases overturned, charges dropped, and even mistrials. With dedication, perseverance, and tenacity, we can work to resolve this issue, and restore your life as quickly as possible.
