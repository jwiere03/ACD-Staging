<h3>About the Crime of Stealing an FTD</h3>
A financial transaction device includes a credit, debit, or ATM card. This also includes any PIN code or other code or instrument that can be used alone or with a picture ID to access a credit or deposit account for credit, goods, cash, or other items of value.

A person may be charged with this offense if he or she takes, removes, steals, possesses, or hides another person’s financial transaction device without permission.

At a trial, the prosecutor must prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction to result:
<ul>
	<li>The defendant obtained possession of the device; and</li>
	<li>He or she <em>knowingly</em> obtained possession of the device; and</li>
	<li>The device was obtained by the defendant  without consent; and</li>
	<li>Finally, the defendant’s intent was to cheat or defraud another person.</li>
</ul>
This offense is classified as a felony.

Additionally, a person who knowingly possesses an altered or fraudulent financial transaction device may also be charged with a felony.

Deviceholders who improperly use a card entrusted by his or her employer may be charged with <a title="Michigan Embezzlement Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html">embezzlement</a>.
