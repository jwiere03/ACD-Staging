<h3>What is Felonious Assault in Michigan?</h3>
A Felonious Assault is nothing more than an assault where a dangerous weapon is involved.  In fact, some people call this crime Assault With a Dangerous Weapon.  The terms "Felonious Assault" and "Assault With a Dangerous Weapon" are interchangeable.  The "dangerous weapon" can be almost anything.  Prosecutors and police bring these charges frequently regardless of what weapon or object is used.  We have had cases where the weapon was :
<ul>
 	<li>an ash tray</li>
 	<li>a plastic pop bottle</li>
 	<li>a firearm</li>
 	<li>a nail protruding from a wall</li>
 	<li>an automobile</li>
 	<li>a potted plant</li>
 	<li>a pitcher of beer</li>
 	<li>a knife</li>
 	<li>a beer bottle</li>
 	<li>brass knuckles</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The list goes on and on.  Basically, if you could think of a way to use an object during an assault, it has probably been used to support a prosecution for a felonious assault.

&nbsp;
<h3>Michigan Felonious Assault Law</h3>
Michigan law states that a person who assaults another individual with a pistol, gun, revolver, knife, iron bar, brass knuckles, club, or other dangerous weapon without intending to kill or inflict great bodily harm may be charged with a felony. The maximum penalty is up to 4 years in prison, a fine up to $2,000.00, or both.

&nbsp;

Keep in mind that the term assault has more than one meaning.  An assault may be nothing more than putting another person in fear of an immediate battery.  The word assault is also commonly used when a battery occurs.  A battery is a harmful or offensive touching.   So, a Felonious Assault does not require any actual contact, but can include it.  A common example of a Felonious Assault charge with no physical contact is the pointing of a gun at another person.

&nbsp;
<h3>Michigan Felonious Assault Defense Lawyers</h3>
An assault charge is typically the classic "He said, She said" scenario.  In the big picture, this scenario favors the defendant when he or she is represented by an attorney with the right combination of skill and experience.  Generally, you are looking for an attorney who has won these cases at jury trial and knows how to cross examine the state's witnesses.  You need an attorney who is going to listen closely to your story and figure out the best way to present that story to a jury.

&nbsp;

Our approach involves extensive attorney / client interaction and extensive trial preparation.  Putting forth the best defense to an assault with a dangerous weapon case means carefully examining every detail with the client and knowing how to approach each witness when they come to the witness stand.  Excellent cross examination skills are critical.

&nbsp;
<h3>Self Defense and the Defense of Others</h3>
One of the most powerful defenses in any assault case is "self defense."  In some instances, the very similar defense of "defense of others"  can be used to accomplish the same thing.  Specifically, we use these defenses to force the prosecution to prove that your actions were not unreasonable activity in defense of self or others.  It is always beneficial to require the prosecution to clear more hurdles at trial.

&nbsp;

It takes a skilled attorney to know how to present these defenses and succeed.  Our attorneys have successfully defended felonious assault cases many times using self defense as a principle defense theory.
