<h3><b>Michigan Heroin Defense Lawyers </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-26003 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canstockphoto9773256-1024x642.jpg" alt="" width="409" height="256" />Since heroin is a Schedule 1 drug, any heroin-related drug conviction will bring with it extremely  serious consequences. Anyone involved in a heroin drug crime could face many years of prison and will need excellent </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Drug Defense Attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fighting on their side. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroin was first created and marketed as a non-addictive alternative to cough suppressants. However, heroin is synthesized from morphine and is indeed very addictive. Once officials realized how addictive heroin truly was, federal and state laws were enacted to make the drug unlawful. Not all countries have drug laws as strict as ours. In fact, it is possible for patients in extreme pain to obtain heroin abroad. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroin has lately become very popular in Michigan. Some nicknames for it are d</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ragon, dope, Big H, mud, horse </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smack</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Heroin is extremely addictive and users quickly build up tolerance to the drug, needing more and more each time the use, to be able to experience the same kind of high. As users up their heroin dosage, they face an increased risk of overdosing. Heroin slows lung function, so death can occur when the user stops breathing or chokes on their own vomit. Heroin is a common drug of choice for people who commit suicide. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>How Heroin is Used</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various ways to ingest heroin. All of them are illegal and all of them can be fatal. One of the most common is referred to as “shooting up,” which is where one injects heroin through the veins. This is problematic because repeated injections into the body cause the veins to become inflamed and eventually collapsed. Users then have to find new veins to use as injection sites. In more serious cases, collapsed veins never fully recover. Still, users choose this intravenous method because it provides the quickest high – just seven or eight seconds. In addition, drug users sharing needles spreads AIDS and hepatitis, both of which can be fatal. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Users may also snort heroin or heat the drug and inhale its vapors. The inhalation tube that is normally used left behind contains drug residue. This is why </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chasing the Dragon </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">became popular, where users reheat the residue to smoke it. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-26004 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canstockphoto2233713-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="431" height="286" />Heroin traces stay in the body for a long time. Heroin can be detected in the user’s blood, hair follicles, urine and plasma. People on probation are often subject to urine drug tests and, if any heroin is detected, the person may be charged with a Michigan </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation violation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the government continues to fight in the “War on Drugs,” both federal and Michigan drug law have continued to tighten. If you are facing a heroin drug charge, you should not expect any leniency from courts and prosecutors. Look for a tough lawyer rather than help from the court. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Penalties for Heroin in Michigan </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroin is a Schedule 1 drug, so it brings with it several penalties for its use and possession. As there are many different types of heroin-related crimes in Michigan, the exact penalty will depend on the defendant’s exact conviction. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Penalties for Heroin Use </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, heroin use is a misdemeanor drug crime. If convicted of heroin use in state court, you may face up to one year in jail, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Penalties for Heroin Possession </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, heroin possession Is a felony drug crime. If convicted of heroin possession, your punishment is based on how much heroin you possessed. Federal penalties are more harsh than state punishments. </span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you possessed less than 50 grams of heroin, you could face </span><b>prison time of up to 4 years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><b>fine of up to $25,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or both. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you possessed 50 to 449 grams of heroin, you could face </span><b>prison time of up to 20 years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><b>fine of up to $250,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or both. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you possessed 450 to 999 grams of heroin, you could face </span><b>prison time of up to 30 years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><b>fine of up to $500,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or both.  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you possessed 1,000 grams or more of heroin, you could face </span><b>life in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><b>fine of $1,000,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or both. </span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3><b>Penalties for Manufacturing and Delivering Heroin </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-26005 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/defense-attorney-840062_1920-1024x806.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="255" />Heroin manufacture, heroin creation, heroin delivery, and heroin possession with the intent to manufacture heroin, create heroin, or deliver heroin are all felony drug crimes. These are Michigan’s most serious heroin crimes. Again, punishment is subject to the amount of Heroin involved. Lots of people are in prison now because of heroin convictions. If the amount of heroin involved in this type of crime was: </span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than 50 grams, you could face </span><b>prison time of up to 20 years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><b>fine of up to $25,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or both. </span></li>

</ul>
&nbsp;
