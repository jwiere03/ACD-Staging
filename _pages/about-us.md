The Kronzek Firm is based in Michigan and practices in an area that includes all 68 counties of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. We are trusted, experienced, and highly accomplished trial attorneys. Each attorney in our firm has experience and expertise in one or more specific areas of the law. We are trusted, experienced, and highly accomplished trial attorneys able to practice both in state and federal courts.
<h3>The Defense Team Concept:</h3>
Throughout Michigan, we have a reputation as a tough, thorough, and skilled law firm. Our attorneys are recognized for challenging false accusations, the testimony of lying witnesses, incorrect identification, faulty scientific evidence, and violations of constitutional rights. Judges and prosecutors know that our defense team is a force to be reckoned with. We are fully prepared to mount an aggressive defense and will leave no stone unturned in fighting for your future.

Our trial attorneys favor a team approach to your case. We often put our heads together to offer you the best legal strategy, regardless of how impossible the situation may seem to you. We have many, many years of successful lawyering under our belts, and it shows. See our long <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Proven-Results">list of the successes</a> we have achieved for our clients in criminal and CPS matters.
<h3>Criminal Defense</h3>
We believe that everybody is entitled to the best defense possible. Unfortunately, not everyone gets a good defense, and Michigan prisons have plenty of people within their walls who are falsely accused of serious crimes. In order to get you that best defense, we team up, as needed, with licensed <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Private-Investigators">private investigators</a>, polygraph examiners, handwriting experts, evidence examiners, criminologists, physicians, pharmacologists, DNA experts, psychologists, human factors experts, forensic pathologists, and others. Our defense team will work diligently and tirelessly to help you achieve the best possible outcome for your criminal case.

Our team-driven philosophy means that we also collaborate with our client, our client’s family members who are helpful, and even friends or co-workers who are willing and able to work with us on the factual development of the defense. Generally, there is no successful defense team that does not maintain an open door to communication with the client. Our attorneys will take your calls, will respond to your e-mails, will review evidence with you, and will discuss the law, the facts, and defense strategies with you.

At The Kronzek Firm we have defended almost every type of criminal offense imaginable. These include:

<h3>Child Abuse and Child Neglect Defense</h3>
Child abuse allegations can be brought to court as either criminal or civil cases. Some of our clients have both types of cases at once. The prosecution goal in a civil case is often the complete and permanent termination of your parental rights. The prosecution goal in a criminal case is usually jail or prison. We have extensive experience defending both types of abuse/neglect cases. It is often best to have one firm handling all of the cases related to the alleged abusive activity.

Children’s Protective Services, otherwise known as CPS, is a division of the Michigan Department of Human Services that investigates allegations involving <a title="Michigan Child Abuse Attorney" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html">child abuse</a> or <a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/practice-areas/child-neglect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">child neglect</a>. CPS is usually the petitioner in a civil neglect/abuse case. In some instances, the case is brought by another agency, such as the prosecutor’s office. CPS investigations can be lengthy and stressful. In the end, CPS can ask the court to terminate your parental rights and take your kids away from you forever. At The Kronzek Firm we believe in fighting to keep families together.

Our trial attorneys have been defending child abuse and neglect cases for many years, and we have achieved many successful results. For more information on our CPS defense activity, see our <a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children's Protective Services Defense web site</a>.
<h3>Sex Crimes</h3>
Michigan sex offenses are some of Michigan’s most serious crimes and can bring up to life in prison and, in some instances, a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. In addition, you could be facing a lifetime of embarrassment by being placed on the <a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/sex-offender-registration-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan Public Sex Offender Registry</a> and even lifetime GPS monitoring. That is why we believe in doing everything possible to defend our clients.

We often get calls from prospective clients stating that they are looking for a sex-crime specialist. The Michigan Bar does not recognize criminal defense specialties, and we are not permitted to call ourselves specialists. Nonetheless, here is what we can accurately state about our firm’s sex crime defense track record:
<ul>
 	<li>We have been taking sex crime cases to trial and winning for almost two decades.</li>
 	<li>Both of our founding partners won the first criminal sexual conduct case they ever tried (and have been winning cases ever since).</li>
 	<li>All of our “first chair” attorneys have had amazing trial results.</li>
 	<li>The firm’s aggressive pre-trial defense work has led to numerous dismissals, not guilty verdicts, no-jail results, no-prison results, and reduced charges (including misdemeanors).</li>
 	<li>Many of our clients have avoided being placed on the Michigan Sex Offender Registry.</li>
 	<li>We have an excellent record in defending juvenile sex crime allegations.</li>
 	<li>Our attorneys have (on more than one occasion) won CSC trials in which the prosecution brought DNA experts from the Michigan State Police Crime Lab to testify against our clients.</li>
 	<li>We offer free initial consultations to clients interested in hiring an attorney.</li>
 	<li>We defend:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html">First Degree CSC</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/second-degree-csc.html">Second Degree CSC</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/third-degree-csc.html">Third degree CSC</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fourth-degree-csc.html">Fourth Degree CSC</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sexting.html">Sexting</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>Drunk Driving</h3>
The Michigan DUI law can be very confusing. We are here to help you. We are expert drunk driving attorneys who regularly defend clients who have been charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drunk-driving.html">drunk driving</a> crimes like Operating While Intoxicated (<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/owi.html">OWI</a>), Operating While Visibly Impaired (<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/owvi.html">OWVI</a>), and Operating With the Presence of Drugs (<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/owpd.html">OWPD</a>). We are well-versed in the Michigan law that deals with operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. We stay current with all the latest law and major court decisions about drunk driving in Michigan. Because it is such a political issue, the DUI law in Michigan is always changing. Therefore, it is very important that you hire a state-of-the-art, cutting-edge defense team that stays up-to-date on the most recent developments in the law. We stay on top of the new drunk driving laws and court cases so that we can offer you the most skilled drunk driving defense team around.

At The Kronzek Firm we know that everybody makes mistakes. Maybe you had too much to drink or used drugs before you operated a vehicle. And just as you may have made a mistake, the police officer or officers who pulled you over may have made one or more mistakes. You see, officers must follow an extensive set of rules when testing to see whether the driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs or is visibly impaired. It is entirely possible that the officer made a mistake, which could change the outcome of your case.

Many attorneys don’t even try to suppress the evidence or beat the case when a client is charged with drunk driving. That is unfortunate. We have helped plenty of clients avoid drunk driving convictions and avoid the loss of their driver’s license.
