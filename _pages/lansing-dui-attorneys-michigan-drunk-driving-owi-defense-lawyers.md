<h2>Lansing Drunk Driving Expert Lawyers</h2>
<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Man-in-Car-with-Police-Lights-Behind-e1397218302173.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3209 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Man-in-Car-with-Police-Lights-Behind-300x199.jpg" alt="Lansing Drunk Driving arrest" width="300" height="199" /></a>The Kronzek Firm's expert Lansing DUI attorneys have been defending clients facing drunk driving charges for nearly 20 years.  Our approach to DUI cases is superior and the results speak for themselves.  Ingham, Eaton and Clinton Counties continue to have high drunk driving arrest rates.  This may be due to the substantial presence of Michigan State Police and the aggressive enforcement by local law enforcement.  Drunk driving convictions can negatively impact your life, your career, and your family.

<h3>Our Approach to Driver's License Restoration</h3>
We like to begin planning for driver's license restoration immediately upon conviction for any offense  that causes an interruption of your driving privileges.  In Michigan, all drug convictions have consequences for driving privileges.  Drunk driving charges do as well.  Getting your license back may require active planning.  We can help you figure out what the road to a successful restoration effort would look like.
<h3>The Advantages of Expert Representation</h3>
It is unfortunate that many criminal defense attorneys in Michigan don't really know how to approach a DUI defense.  The laws in Michigan continue to make drunk driving defense challenging, and many attorneys don't really try to defend clients.  Many defendants don't really think a case is winnable because they know they were drinking.  The fact of the matter is that there are many ways to defend a drunk driving case.  A knowledgable and skilled attorney will know how to examine a case carefully for the best possible defense.
