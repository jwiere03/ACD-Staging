<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20150218_143229.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-6285 size-medium" title="Jackson Michigan Police Department Vehicle in front of the Jackson County Courthouse" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20150218_143229-300x169.jpg" alt="20150218_143229" width="300" height="169" /></a>If you're facing criminal charges in Jackson County, you need to take action. Whether your investigation is being handled by the Jackson County Sheriff, the Jackson Police department, the Blackmun Township Police Department, or even the Michigan State Police, we can help.  Without an experienced Michigan criminal defense attorney on your side, you prosecutors will have the upper hand.  Court appointed attorneys can be helpful, but sometimes they are so overworked and under budgeted that you can't even get a return phone call or copy of your own police report.  With all that is at stake in your criminal case, you probably can't afford the gamble of being poorly represented. When the odds against you seem overwhelming, let the experienced and aggressive criminal defense attorneys of The Kronzek Firm PLC help.
