<h2>Michigan Computer Hacking Defense</h2>
Michigan law prohibits an individual from intentionally accessing or causing access to be made to a (1) computer; (2) computer system; (3) computer program; or (4) computer network to create or execute a plan with the intent to defraud, that is, to gain property, money, or a service from another person using a false representation or promise.  If you are accused of accessing computers or hacking or any other computer crime, you can rely on the expert criminal defense attorneys at The Kronzek Firm to help you.  We offer free consultations and excellent defense.  Call us a (866) 766-5245.
<h2><strong>Penalties for Computer Hacking</strong></h2>
The potential penalties to this offense are determined by the aggregate amount involved in the violation. “Aggregate amount” means any indirect or direct loss of the targeted individuals. This includes but is not limited to: any property, money, or service stolen, lost, or made unrecoverable; additionally, this includes any money spent by individuals verifying an affected computer, computer system, computer program, or computer network was not taken, altered, damaged, or destroyed by the access. The value of the loss as part of this course of conduct may be added up over a 12 month period to determine the total loss.

For a violation involving an aggregate amount under $200.00, the individual may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of up to 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00 or 3 times the aggregate amount, whichever is greater, or both.

If the violation involves either: (a) an aggregate amount of $200.00 up to $1,000.00, or (b) there is a prior conviction, then the individual may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 1 year in jail, or a fine up to $2,000.00 or 3 times the aggregate amount, whichever is greater, or both.

Next, if the violation involves either: (a) an aggregate amount of $1,000.00 up to $20,000.00, or (b) two prior convictions, then the individual may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty up to 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00 or 3 times the aggregate amount, whichever is greater, or both.

Additionally, if the violation involves either: (a) an aggregate amount of $20,000.00 or more, or (b) three or more prior convictions, then the person may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine up to 3 times the aggregate amount, or both.

The following may also be seized: (1) all money, income, and proceeds earned but not yet received by a third party as part of this offense; and (2) all computer software, computer equipment, and personal property that the owner was aware to have been used in connection with the violation.
