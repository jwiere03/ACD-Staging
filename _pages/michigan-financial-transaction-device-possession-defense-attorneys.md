<h3><b>Possession of Another Person’s Financial Transaction Device with Intent to Deliver, Use, Circulate or Sell</b></h3>
Possessing, controlling, or receiving from another person a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">financial transaction device </span>[link to Stealing a Financial Transaction Device article] with the intent to (a)  deliver; (b) use; (c) circulate; or (d) sell it is prohibited by law.

Additionally, it is prohibited for a person to cause, permit, or procure the device to be delivered, used, circulated, or sold, <i>knowing</i> the control, possession, receipt, delivery, use, circulation, or sale is without consent.

At trial, the prosecutor must prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction to result:
<ol>
	<li>The defendant had the device in his or her possession or under his or her control (or received the device from another person); and</li>
	<li>At the time, the defendant knew he or she was receiving, controlling, or possessing the device without the deviceholder’s consent; and</li>
	<li>The defendant intended to cause or permit another person to deliver, use, circulate, or sell this device; and</li>
	<li>When this occurred, the defendant intended to cheat or defraud another person.</li>
</ol>
A person committing this offense may be charged with a felony.

Furthermore , delivery, circulation or sale of such a device—or using, permitting, causing, or gaining the device to be used, circulated, delivered, or sold, knowing the device was obtained under prohibited circumstances is also a felony.

Finally, an individual  who forges, counterfeits, simulates, or alters a financial transaction device in a material way could also be charged with a felony.
