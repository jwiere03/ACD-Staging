<h3>Commercial Gun Sales Regulations</h3>
Any person who engages in the business of retail sales of pistols, guns, or firearm silencers who does not keep a register of purchasers may be charged with a misdemeanor. The register must contain the name, occupation, age, and residence of each and every single purchaser, including the identification number or other mark of the firearm. This register must be available for inspection by peace officers at all times as well.
<h3><strong>Intentionally Making a Material False Statement Related to a Pistol Purchase</strong></h3>
A person who obtains a pistol in violation of the provisions of MCL 28.422 may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of up to 90 days in jail, a fine up to $100.00, or both. However, this does not apply to those who purchased the firearm in violation of the statute before the 1990 amendatory act, were not subsequently convicted, and obtained a licensed within 90 days after the effective date.

In addition, a person who intentionally makes a false material statement on an application for a license to purchase a pistol may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 4 years in prison, a fine up to $2,000.00, or both.

Those who use or attempt to use false identification or the identification of another individual to purchase a gun may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of up to 90 days in jail, a fine up to $100.00, or both.
