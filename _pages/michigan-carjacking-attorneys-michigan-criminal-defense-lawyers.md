<h3>What is Carjacking in Michigan?</h3>
Carjacking occurs when an individual uses or threatens violence or force against another person in the course of stealing a motor vehicle. Additionally, this includes putting any driver, passenger, or lawful possessor of a motor vehicle—or even any person lawfully pursuing recovery of the motor vehicle—in a state of fear.

The activities covered by this statute are:
<ul>
	<li>Acts that happen when attempting to steal a vehicle;</li>
	<li>During commission of the theft itself;</li>
	<li>While fleeing the scene after committing the offense; or</li>
	<li>While attempting to retain possession of the car, truck, etc.</li>
</ul>
To provearjacking at trial, the following must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt:
<ul>
	<li>The defendant used force or violence against or assaulted the victim,</li>
	<li>While in the course of committing a larceny of a motor vehicle, and</li>
	<li>The victim was the operator, passenger, or person in lawful possession of the motor vehicle.</li>
</ul>
In this context, larceny is the taking and movement of someone else’s motor vehicle with the intent to take it away from that person permanently. Carjacking requires driving the vehicle away because the term <em>larceny</em> requires the carrying away or asportation of the property in question.

Literally speaking, the defendant would not have to intend to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle. Lack of purpose to return the property taken within a reasonable amount of time is enough. Since it is difficult to prove a defendant’s state of mind, only minimal circumstantial evidence of intent is required.

Carjacking tends to occur in metropolitan areas but may happen anywhere. Some common carjacking scenarios include: (1) When a person is either entering or exiting a car, he or she is then “jumped” by an assailant; (2) A car is invaded while stopped at a traffic light at an intersection; or (3) A defendant purposely rear-ends another car. When the parties exit the vehicle to exchange insurance information, then the carjacker has an opportunity to steal the other person’s vehicle including its contents.
