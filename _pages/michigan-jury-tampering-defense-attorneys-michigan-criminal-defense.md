<h2>What is Jury Tampering?</h2>
An individual who willfully tries to influence a juror’s decision in any case by either persuasion or argument other than as part of the trial proceedings may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty up to a year in jail, a fine up to $1,000.00, or both.

A person who willfully tries to influence a juror’s decision in any case by using intimidation other than as part of the trial proceedings may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 4 years in prison, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both.

If the intimidation occurs in a criminal case where the defendant’s maximum penalty is (a) more than 10 years in prison; or (b) for life in prison or any term of years, then the person may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine up to $20,000.00, or both.

Additionally, if the intimidation involves the commission or attempted commission of a crime or threat to injure or kill any person, or to cause property damage, then the person may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, a fine up to $25,000.00, or both.

<strong>Retaliation Against Jurors</strong>

An individual who threatens to retaliate, attempts to retaliate, or retaliates against another person for participating on a jury may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine up to $20,000.00, or both.

Retaliation means: (a) Attempted commission or commission of a crime against any individual; or (b) Threatening to injure or kill any individual or threatening to inflict property damage.

<strong>Recording or Attempting to Record Jury Deliberations</strong>

Michigan law prohibits any person from recording or attempting to record the deliberation of a jury in any case. If a person is in violation, he or she may be charged with a misdemeanor.
