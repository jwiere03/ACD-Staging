<h3> Expert Murder Defense Lawyers</h3>
An incredible amount of resources go into investigating and prosecuting murder cases.  A criminal defendant being investigated for homicide faces a daunting challenge.  He should not face that challenge alone.  Because murder charges often come with the possibility of mandatory life in prison with no possibility of parole, the person arrested and accused deserves the best possible defense.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3> What is Open Murder?</h3>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>Open murder is when the prosecutor has not decided between first degree or second degree murder, but will allow the jury to choose the most appropriate option instead. In addition, second-degree murder happens to be a lesser included crime of first-degree murder. So the jury may be instructed upon this charge as well, if supported by the evidence.

&nbsp;
<h3> What is First-Degree Murder?</h3>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>First-degree murder is a specific-intent crime and premeditated act. This means the defendant intended and carried out plans to kill another person. This is a specific-intent crime.  Those individuals who are convicted of first-degree murder face life in prison without eligibility for parole.

&nbsp;

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>For a conviction to result, the prosecutor must prove all parts (or elements) of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. First, it must be proven that the defendant killed another individual. Next, the prosecution needs to show the defendant intended to cause the death. Third, premeditation must be shown. In addition, the prosecutor must show that the killing was deliberate; and therefore, contemplated and weighed out.

&nbsp;

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>Overall, this type of crime is not a heat-of-the-moment passion killing. This is also not one where there are legal excuses that would reduce it to a lesser crime. This criminal charge is meant for individuals who think about and specifically carry out plans to end another person’s life.  Lying in wait—which is hiding in order to kill a person—is an example of premeditated murder. Another example is poisoning.

&nbsp;
<h3>First-Degree Felony Murder</h3>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>There are many situations that fall under the category of first-degree felony murder.  At trial, the prosecutor must prove all parts of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. First, that the defendant caused the death of another person that was not legally excused or reduced to a lesser crime. Next, it must be shown the defendant intended to kill, cause great bodily harm, or created a very high risk of great bodily harm or death. Third, that the defendant was committing or attempting to commit a felony when the death occurred. In addition, the prosecutor must prove the underlying felony as well.

&nbsp;

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>In other words, this is murder that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a number of serious crimes, which include: arson; first-degree child abuse; CSC or criminal sexual conduct (either first, second or third-degree); major drug offenses; carjacking; robbery; breaking and entering into a home; first or second-degree home invasion; any type of larceny or theft; kidnapping; extortion; first or second-degree vulnerable adult abuse; aggravated stalking; and torture.

&nbsp;

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>In addition, it is first-degree murder to kill a police officer, jail, or prison guard; parole or probation officer; and more; while in the course of performing his or her job duties.

&nbsp;
<h3> Second-Degree Murder</h3>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>All other types of murder are considered second-degree murder. In other words, second-degree murder is not a specific-intent crime.  The maximum penalty is life in prison, or any term of years, at the court’s discretion.

&nbsp;

<strong><strong> </strong></strong>The prosecutor must prove all the parts of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction to result at trial. First, the defendant must be shown to have caused another person’s death. Second, that the defendant had the state of mind of intending to kill, cause great bodily harm, or create a very high risk or great bodily harm or death. Third, it must be shown the killing was not a justified one, legally excused, or committed under circumstances that would reduce it to a lesser offense.
