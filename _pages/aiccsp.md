All sex related crimes require the assistance of a qualified defense attorney. All sex related crimes have the potential of jail or prison and the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html">sex offender registry</a>. Strangely, not all sex related crimes require sexual contact or penetration.

Assault with Intent to Commit Criminal Sexual Conduct Involving Penetration is one of the more obscure sex related charges in Michigan. To prove this offense at trial, the prosecutor must show beyond a reasonable doubt:
<ol>
 	<li>(a) That the defendant committed an assault; and</li>
 	<li>(b) The defendant intended to commit CSC involving penetration.</li>
</ol>
An assault is an attempt to commit a battery or an illegal act that places another person in reasonable fear of an immediate battery.

Generally, A person may be charged within 10 years after the crime, or by the alleged victim’s 21st birthday, whichever is later, although there are exceptions. Furthermore, this crime is also not necessarily the same as an attempted CSC. That is because the prosecution is not required to prove an actual attempt to commit the CSC.

Having a seasoned team of trial veterans like the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html">The Kronzek Firm's attorneys</a> is advantageous. We know the law—and we’ve been in the trenches for about 100 combined years defending various sex crime and felony cases.

<h2>PENALTIES</h2>
Assault with Intent to Commit CSC involving penetration is a felony offense with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Additionally, this is a Tier III offense requiring registration under the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html">Sex Offenders Registration Act</a>, unless the court determines the alleged victim consented to the activity and was between 13 and 16 years old while the defendant was no more than 4 years older. Tier III offenders must register for life, unless special requirements are met to exit the registry early.
