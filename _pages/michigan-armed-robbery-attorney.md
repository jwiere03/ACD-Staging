<h1><b>What is Armed Robbery?</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26032 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/money-943782_1920-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Robbery is defined as a theft crime where somebody uses threat or force to permanently take property from another person. An armed robbery conviction is a felony with a maximum penalty of </span><b>life in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the robbery involves a serious injury or aggravated assault, there is a minimum penalty of at least two years in prison. Robbery without a dangerous weapon, called unarmed robbery, is still a felony punishable by up to </span><b>15 years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in prison.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get a conviction of armed robbery, the prosecutor must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the defendant committed violence against or used force, put in fear, or assaulted another human being. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26034 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/canstockphoto18192391-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Second, that the accused did this while committing larceny. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-larceny-attorney-larceny-building-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Larceny”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the taking of a person’s property or money with the intent to permanently deprive them of possession.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An attempt to commit larceny, fleeing the scene of a larceny, and other situations are also included in this definition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the alleged victim subject to the larceny needs to have been present while the defendant committed the act. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, while the accused was “in the course of committing the larceny,” he or she </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1) had a dangerous weapon capable of causing serious injury or death; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2) had any other item capable of causing serious injury or death that was used as a weapon; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3) had an object that was used or made in a way to lead the person present to believe it was indeed a dangerous weapon; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">4) told the victim or otherwise represented that the accused had a weapon. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, if applicable, it must be proven that the suspect inflicted a serious injury or aggravated assault to another person while committing the larceny.</span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>Some Considerations with Armed Robbery</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26035 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killer-820017_1280-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />In order to prove the “armed” aspect of armed robbery, the prosecutor usually either proves the existence of a weapon with evidence, or an eyewitness testifies he or she saw the weapon while the defendant committed the robbery. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are cases, however, where the defendant will pretend to have a weapon to simply frighten a victim into compliance. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In that case, the prosecutor does not need to show evidence of an actual weapon. Here, the prosecutor would need to show that the perpetrator somehow simulated having a weapon and that the victim reasonably believed the robber was armed. An example would be if a victim saw a bulging pocket and the accused said that a robbery was occurring. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, a dangerous weapon is any object with the capability of causing serious injury or death—and is used as a weapon. The jury decides whether an object is a dangerous weapon under the circumstances, depending on the characteristics of the object and how it was used in this particular case. Finally, the larceny does not need to be completed in order to uphold a conviction of robbery or armed robbery. Simply attempting larceny is a crime in itself.</span>
