An Unlawful Imprisonment prosecution can be difficult if not impossible to handle without a skilled trial attorney at your side.  Fortunately the attorneys at The Kronzek Firm can help.  We have decades of experience at every type of criminal defense and we provide aggressive criminal defense to our clients.

&nbsp;
<h3>Michigan Unlawful Imprisonment Laws</h3>
Unlawful imprisonment is a variant of <a title="Michigan Kidnapping Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-kidnapping-attorneys-michigan-kidnapping-defense-lawyers.html">kidnapping</a> and is not only prohibited by law, there are severe penalties if convicted.  Unlawful imprisonment involves knowingly restraining another person under any of the following circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li>The individual is restrained by use of a dangerous instrument or weapon.</li>
 	<li>The restrained individual is secretly confined.</li>
 	<li>The individual was restrained (a) to facilitate the commission of another felony (like murder, CSC, etc.) or (b) to aid flight after committing a felony.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

"Restrain" means to <b><i>forcibly</i></b> confine a person as to interfere with his or her liberty without consent or lawful authority; or to forcibly restrict a person's movements. There restraint could be for any length of time may be incidental to or related to other criminal acts.

&nbsp;

"Secretly confined" means either to keep the location of the restrained individual a secret or the confinement itself a secret.

&nbsp;

A person who commits unlawful imprisonment may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, a fine up to $20,000.00, or both. A person charged with this crime may also be charged with other crimes that arise from the same incident.

<h3>Defending Unlawful Imprisonment Cases</h3>

&nbsp;

Because of the severity of  sentences for an unlawful imprisonment conviction, people facing a prosecution for this criminal offense need an excellent defense from a top rated lawyer.  A poor defense can mean jail or prison.

&nbsp;
<h3>Remember Your Rights</h3>
One of the most important things an attorney can do for you if you are charged with unlawful imprisonment is to defend your constitutional rights.  Often, police trample over your rights when trying to get you to confess, when trying to gather evidence or when arresting a defendant.  The violation of rights can be a powerful issue in your criminal defense if you have the right attorney.

&nbsp;

Sometimes, people go through cases with an attorney that does not know how to assert constitutional defenses.  Sometimes, attorneys just don't put forth enough effort.  Our philosophy is that every client deserves the best possible defense.  If you want a consultation with one of our felony defense attorneys, call today for a free consultation at (866) 7-NoJail.  Our <a title="Michigan Criminal Trial Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html">attorneys </a> are available by appointment and 24/7 for emergency situations.

&nbsp;
<h3>Best Approach to Unlawful Imprisonment</h3>
The best defense always comes when we roll up our sleeves and work together.  Our approach to criminal defense is the team approach.  The team always involves the client.  We generally won't work with clients unless they are willing to work alongside of us.  You may find working with The Kronzek Firm attorneys different to any experiences you have ever had with attorneys.  Welcome to the team!
