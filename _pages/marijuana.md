Marijuana is the most widely-used drug in the world.  It is created from dried cannabis plants. People have been using Marijuana since roughly the year 3,000 B.C.E. However, Michigan law enforcement, and the Federal Government, targets the illegal use of Marijuana.

&nbsp;
<h3>The Michigan Medical Marijuana Act</h3>
In 2008, Michigan passed the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act. This law allows for the medicinal use of Marijuana by qualified patients. However, some of these patients’ homes are still being raided and their supplies seized from Michigan law enforcement.   Unfortunately, these patients can still face drug convictions and need the assistance of a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/medical-marijuana.html">Michigan Medical Marijuana Attorney</a>.

Marijuana use does have some positive effects on its users, including elimination of nausea and vomiting, stimulation of hunger in sick patients, and pain relief. However, there are also some negative effects, as well.

These can include:
<ul>
 	<li>distorted perceptions,</li>
 	<li>impaired coordination,</li>
 	<li>difficulty problem solving,</li>
 	<li>heart problems, and</li>
 	<li>memory loss that can last for days after use.</li>
</ul>
Anti-Marijuana groups argue that Marijuana is a "gateway drug," meaning that Marijuana users will eventually become bored with Marijuana and move onto harder drugs such as <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html">Heroin</a> or <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html">Cocaine</a>, although the research in support of this proposition is suspect.  The chemicals from Marijuana stay in the body for a significant amount of time and can be detected in the blood, hair, and urine. Detection is especially easy if the person tested is a frequent Marijuana user.

As a general rule, Marijuana can be detected in the urine for at least 30 days, and longer in a hair follicle test. If you are on probation and required to give a urine sample, you could have a Michigan <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html">probation violation</a> charge if you "drop dirty" due to the detection of Marijuana metabolites. Probation violations in Michigan can lead to a re-sentencing on the original crime, and the defendant could end up going to prison.

Though Marijuana-related offenses are the most common of all the drug crimes, the penalties are still harsh if you are caught with Marijuana, Hash, or Hash Oil.

&nbsp;
