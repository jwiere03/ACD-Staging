<h3><b>What is vehicular manslaughter?</b></h3>
Simply put, Vehicular manslaughter is the causing of another person’s death using a motor vehicle under circumstances that would not support a murder charge.

Car accidents are a common occurrence in Michigan, especially with road conditions like the pot holes here. However, the issue can turn to vehicular homicide when an accident is caused by a person’s negligence as opposed to being caused by ordinary instances of mechanical failure or perhaps rain and ice on a roadway.

Such criminal charges usually arise in cases of reckless driving, speeding, driving with knowledge of a dangerous mechanical condition, and sometimes driving drunk.
<h3><b>What are the criminal penalties for vehicular manslaughter?</b></h3>
Penalties will vary based on the circumstances of the case. If the reckless driving results in the death of another person, the driver may be charged with a felony. In such instances, the maximum penalty is 15 years in prison, a fine of $2,500.00 to $10,000.00, or both.

If an individual causes the death of a police officer, firefighter, or an emergency responder, the person may be charged with a felony as well. However, the penalty increases to a maximum of 20 years in prison, a fine of $2,500.00 to $10,000.00, or both.

In drunk driving[link to appropriate drunk driving page] cases resulting in death, the driver can expect severe penalties above and beyond license sanctions and fees, especially for a second or subsequent occurrences. This includes prison time. Therefore, it is critical to immediately hire aggressive and experience attorneys to help preserve your freedom.
<h3><b>Our Approach to Vehicular Manslaughter Defense</b></h3>
Automobile death cases tend to be thoroughly investigated by police.  Most larger police and sheriff departments have officers trained in accident reconstruction.  Other departments may rely on the Michigan State Police accident reconstruction team.  Most criminal defense attorneys would not have a fundamental working knowledge of accident reconstruction.   The Kronzek Firm has extensive experience working with accident reconstruction experts from Michigan and elsewhere in the United States.

A viable defense to a Vehicular Manslaughter case, or any automobile death case for that matter, starts with a detailed analysis of the police investigation.  We work closely with our client, and with our expert witnesses to create a defense.  Also, eyewitness accounts can be extremely important.  It should never be assumed that a witness will actually testify to statements made in a police report.  Police often bring their own bias or lack of accuracy to their reports.

In many instances, we find it necessary to examine the scene ourselves.  We often create our own photographs of the scene and the vehicles involved.  This is especially important because the evidence at the scene will change over time, as will vehicles stored out of doors.

Damage control is an important part of any vehicle death case.  There is often an incredible amount of hostility coming from family members who have lost a loved one.  While we would not publish our damage control strategies on a web site, our clients are familiar with our approach.

By working closely with our clients, we find solutions to difficult situations.  By being good litigators, we bring the quality of representation that clients need and deserve.
