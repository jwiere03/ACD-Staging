<h2><b>What is Vulnerable Adult Abuse?</b></h2>
Vulnerable Adult Abuse felonies in Michigan are serious charges that can lead to jail, prison and fines.  These charges are emotionally charged for juries and require a serious defense. The law firm of The Kronzek Firm has successfully defended these charges.  The best way to avoid a significant sentence is to avoid being found guilty.   If you or a loved one is charged with any type of abuse crime, our experienced defense team can help.  Call (866) 766-5245 to consult with one of our attorneys.

The Vulnerable Adult Abuse Act criminalizes abuse of a specific category of adults.  Some people may refer to the crime as "elder abuse," however, there is no requirement that the alleged victim be a senior citizen.  Vulnerable adult abuse is where a caregiver who directly cares for or has physical custody of a vulnerable adult abuses that person under his or her supervision.  A “vulnerable adult” is either (1) a person over age 18 who requires personal care or supervision and cannot live independently due to developmental disability, physical disability,  mental illness, or age. (2) An adult in need of adult protective services; or (3) An individual living in an adult foster care home.
<h3><b></b>First Degree Vulnerable Adult Abuse<b></b></h3>

<h3><b>Financial Exploitation of a Vulnerable Adult</b></h3>
The Anti-Exploitation Act prohibits individuals from using deceit, fraud, unjust enrichment, or coercion to gain control of a vulnerable adult’s money when it is known or there is reason to know this is indeed a vulnerable adult. In other words, this is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embezzlement</span> [link to embezzlement page] from a vulnerable adult.

If (a) the value of the property or money obtained is $50,000.00 to $100,000.00 or (b) the value of the property or money is $20,000.00 to $50,000.00 plus two or more prior convictions, then this is a felony with a maximum penalty up to 15 years in prison, a fine up to $15,000.00, or 3 times the value of the property or money, whichever is greater, or both.

Finally, if (a) the value of the property or money is $100,000.00 or more or (b) the value of the property or money is $50,000.00 to $100,000.00 plus two or more prior convictions, then this is a felony with a maximum penalty up to 20 years in prison, a fine up to $50,000.00, or 3 times the value of the property or money, whichever is greater, or both.
