<h2><strong>Larceny of a Rented Motor Vehicle, Trailer, or Other Property</strong></h2>
Michigan Statutes have specific provisions making stealing rented property of any type a criminal offense.  The experienced trial attorneys at The Kronzek Firm have extensive experience defending theft charges throughout Michigan.  There are many benefits to having seasoned legal counsel when facing criminal prosecution. Every day without competent representation presents a risk that a defendant will  compromise the outcome of his or her case.
<h2>The Crime of Larceny of Rented Property in Michigan</h2>
A person who possesses a motor vehicle, trailer, or other property under a written rental or lease agreement and intends to defraud or willfully neglects to return the item after the expiration date as stated in a written notice may be charged with larceny.
<h3><strong>Penalties</strong></h3>
If the value of the automobile, trailer, etc; is (a) $20,000.00 or more; or (b) $1,000.00 to $20,000.00 plus two or more convictions for committing or attempting to commit an offense under this section minus certain exceptions, then a person may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine up to $15,000.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.

For a value of (a) $1,000.00 up to $20,000.00; or (b) $200.00 to $1,000.00 plus 1 or more convictions for committing or attempting to commit an offense under this section minus some exceptions, then a person may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.

If the value is (a) $200.00 to $1,000.00; or (b) Less than $200.00 plus 1 or more prior convictions for committing or attempting to commit an offense under this section or a substantially similar local ordinance, then an individual may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 1 year in jail, a fine up to $2,000.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.

For a value less than $200.00, then a person may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.

The values of property—not returned in separate instances as part of a scheme or course of conduct within any 12-month period—may be added together to determine the total value taken.
