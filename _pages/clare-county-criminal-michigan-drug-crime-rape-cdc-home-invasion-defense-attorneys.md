<h3>Clare County Criminal Lawyers</h3>
The Kronzek Firm PLC offers expert criminal defense to our Michigan clients.  For immediate assistance contact us at 866-766-5245

If you’ve been arrested on criminal charges in Clare County, there are two critical things should consider. First, you should avoid helping law enforcement build their case against you. The police are working with prosecutors to put you in jail, so whatever you say to them may come back to haunt you in the future. Most Michigan Criminal Defense Attorneys will tell you to politely refuse to answer any questions about your case, and invoke your right to silence.

Second, you need to call an aggressive Clare County criminal defense attorney who will fight for your rights. Whether you find yourself in a Clare County jail, a police station, or are being questioned in your home or car, the best thing you can do is call the offices of The Kronzek Firm. Our team of tough, coordinated attorneys have decades of experience defending clients from criminal charges of all types.  Whether you are in Clare, Harrison, Farwell or elsewhere, we can help.  We are licensed to practice law in all state and federal courts in Michigan.

We know our way around Clare County’s court system in Harrison, and we’re ready to put our expertise to work defending you in the 55th Circuit Court or 80th District Court. Don’t pick your attorney based on the amount of attorney fees alone.   Often the cheapest lawyers end up costing you more than you can afford.

Don’t wait to turn your case around and face your accusers. The sooner you call us, the better. Our phone lines are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Just call <b>1-866-7-NOJAIL</b> for a free consultation with one of our attorneys.
