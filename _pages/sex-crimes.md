Sex crimes is a term used to refer to a wide variety of crimes that the law has determined are sexual in nature. This variety is reflected in the law, because each offense is "labeled" in a different way, and will result in different penalties. There are, however, certain similarities with regard to all of these crimes - if convicted, a person is very likely to go to prison for a number of years, and be registered as a sex offender upon their release. The following is a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, list of links to information about different charges and penalties pertaining to sex crimes in Michigan:

&nbsp;
<h3>1st Degree CSC</h3>
1st Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct is considered to be the most serious of the four degrees of CSC under Michigan law. In addition to the fact that 1st degree CSC involves sexual penetration of the victim, there must be at least one other factor involved. Either the victim was under 13 at the time, the perpetrator was armed with a weapon, force or coercion was used to get the victim to submit, or the perpetrator was in a position of authority over the victim.

&nbsp;
<h3>2nd Degree CSC</h3>
2nd Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct involves only sexual contact with the victim, but not penetration of any kind. But despite the fact that penetration does not occur, this is still considered to be a very serious crime. Sexual contact involves the intimate touching of the victim's genital area or intimate body parts. Most commonly, someone facing this charge is accused of having sexual contact with a minor under the age of 13.

&nbsp;
<h3>3rd Degree CSC</h3>
3rd Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct, like 1st degree CSC, involves sexual penetration of the victim. In this scenario, the victim is either under the legal age of consent, unable to consent to sex due to mental incapacity, or the perpetrator used force to achieve the sex. The most common form of 3rd degree CSC that we encounter is what is called "statutory rape." This tends to happen when the sex was consensual, but the people involved were teenagers, one of whom was below the age of consent.

&nbsp;
<h3>4th Degree CSC</h3>
4th Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct, like 2nd degree CSC, involves no penetration of the victim, but refers instead to intimate sexual touching of the victim's intimate body parts, including genitals. A 4th degree CSC charge usually applies to sexual contact in a situation where the perpetrator is in a position of power or authority over the victim, or they use force or coercion to achieve the contact. This also applies if the victim is in any way mentally incapacitated at the time.

&nbsp;
<h3>Assault with Intent to Commit Criminal Sexual Penetration</h3>
Assault With Intent To Commit Criminal Sexual Penetration refers to the act of assaulting someone with the intention of forcing them to have sex. This charge is not used often in Michigan, and can be harder to prove at trial. This is because the prosecution must prove that an assault did take place, and that the perpetrator intended to sexually penetrate the victim, but didn't for whatever reason.

&nbsp;
<h3>Assault with Intent to Commit Sexual Conduct II (CSC 2) Involving Contact</h3>
Assault With Intent To Commit Sexual Conduct II Involving Contact is similar in nature to the previously mentioned crime. It is also a rarely used charge in Michigan and requires that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused assaulted someone for the purpose of having sexual contact with them.

&nbsp;
<h3>Federal Child Pornography Laws</h3>
Although both federal and State child pornography laws are aggressively prosecuted, it is a widely accepted fact that federal law is stricter, and carries harsher penalties for the convicted. For this reason, many people in Michigan who are accused of producing, distributing, or possessing child pornography of any kind are prosecuted on a federal level.

&nbsp;
<h3>Michigan Child Pornography Laws</h3>
Under Michigan law, child pornography is referred to as "child sexually abusive material," and carries severe penalties for anyone convicted. These crimes include producing, distributing or possessing child pornography, but also enticing a child into producing a sexually abusive image. This can include what is currently known as "sexting."

&nbsp;
<h3>Sexting</h3>
Sexting, a term that conjoins the words "sex" and "texting," refers to written descriptions of sexual interactions between two or more people, along with sexually explicit images and videos. These are usually taken and shared using cell phones. This is a common phenomenon among teenagers nowadays, and has led to many high school kids facing criminal charges for storing and sharing sexually explicit images of their peers, who are also minors.

&nbsp;
<h3>Sex Offender Registry</h3>
Michigan has a sex offender registry where all persons convicted of sex crimes are legally required to register. The sex offender registry is a searchable online database, open to the public, which includes identifying information, along with addresses and photographs, of all known sex offenders living in the state.

&nbsp;
<h3>Sexually Delinquent Person</h3>
"Sexually delinquent person" is a term that refers to a person who, according to the court, suffers from a specific kind of sexual behavior. This includes compulsively disregarding other people's rights, refusing to acknowledge consequences, using force against their victims, or consistently preferring victims who are underaged.
