<h2>Lapeer Criminal Defense Lawyers</h2>
<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20150609_0836421-e1434488781666.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-6743" title="Lapeer Courthouse" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20150609_0836421-e1434488733551-300x169.jpg" alt="Lapeer County Courthouse, Lapeer, Michigan" width="300" height="169" /></a>Choosing the right attorney is sometimes the most difficult decision you have to make. A successful Lapeer County criminal defense requires an attorney who can assess the facts accurately, understands the relevant Michigan statutes and case law, and knows how to present the issues correctly to a jury.  It also requires a commanding presence in the courtroom and good old fashioned trial skill.  A successful defense requires a strong attorney-client relationship founded on trust and cooperation. We insist that our clients be ready to roll up their sleeves along with us and work toward the best outcome.  We offer free consultations in order to assess whether our firm is a good fit for you. To schedule your absolutely confidential consultation, just call our office at 1-866-7NOJAIL or fill out our <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html">contact form</a> with some basic information about yourself and your charges.
<h2>Lapeer Criminal Sexual Conduct Defense Attorneys</h2>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-7143 size-medium" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lapeer-county-sheriff-300x169.jpg" alt="Lapeer-county-sheriff-department-patrol-vehicle" width="300" height="169" />The defense of Criminal Sexual Conduct or CSC cases requires the special abilities of well-trained trial attorneys who know how to handle cases that involve false allegations, manipulation of witnesses, intimidating police tactics and DNA evidence. This is especially true if your accuser is a step-daughter, step-son or other child. If you are being contacted by the Lapeer County Sheriff department,  a police agency or a CPS investigator, you need to stop talking to them immediately and contact one of our experienced trial attorneys.  CSC cases often involve kids who are being influenced by adults.  Often, this manipulation is done by family members who themselves have an agenda or mistaken belief.  Sometimes it is the result of hostility arising out of a custody battle or family tensions.  Sometimes it is police officers, CPS investigators or counselors who think they know something bad happened.  The Kronzek Firm attorneys have been successfully defending against false reports of rape and sexual molestation for over 20 years.  If you have a loved one that is facing this problem, you owe it to yourself to have a confidential consultation with one of our trial attorneys.
<h2>Lapeer County CPS Defense Lawyers</h2>
In addition to criminal defense, our firm handles complex child abuse cases throughout Michigan.  We defend allegations brought by Children's Protective Services and the Department of Health and Human Services on a daily basis.  Over the years, we have developed specialized knowledge and skill that equips us to handle termination of parental rights cases.  Our cases often involve allegations of Shaken Baby Syndrome, Abusive Head Trauma, Brittle Bones disease, and Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.  If you are facing a case with Children's Protective Services, you owe it to yourself to see what an expert defense can do for you.  We have defended medically complex cases throughout Michigan and our attorneys are know for their courtroom expertise and tenacious defense of parents and caregivers.
<h2>Lapeer County Heroin - Methamphetamine - Drug Defense</h2>

As prosecution for drug crimes increases and the sentences become harsher, it is important to have the best defense possible if you are facing a major felony drug prosecution.  This is true for cases in both state and federal court.  Lapeer area federal cases are litigated in the Eastern District Federal Court, where our attorneys have been licensed and maintained a practice for many years.  Even those cases handled in the Lapeer County Circuit court can result in very long prison sentences.  To avoid prison from a drug prosecution, you are going to need an experienced constitutional lawyer.  This is because the best defenses in a Methamphetamine, Heroin or other drug case is probably going to be based on violations of your rights.  Not every attorney is equipped to handle this type of argument in court.  Our attorneys are trained to litigate violations of your rights that you might not have thought about.  By being aggressive and competent, we have been able to get amazing results around the state of Michigan.
