Individuals charged with certain sex offenses may also be charged with being a “sexually delinquent person” as well. This is not a separate offense, but instead an alternate sentencing provision or sentencing enhancement. A conviction as a sexually delinquent person is totally dependent upon conviction of the underlying crime.

&nbsp;

The underlying crimes are the various forms of gross indecency, sodomy/bestiality, and indecent exposure. At <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html">The Kronzek Firm </a>, our team has a long history of experience defending <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html">sex crimes</a>.

&nbsp;
<h3>What is a sexually delinquent person in MIchigan?</h3>
This is defined as an individual whose sexual behavior is characterized by any of the following:
<ul class="county-lis">
 	<li>Compulsive or repetitive acts indicating a disregard of consequences or the recognized rights of other people; or</li>
 	<li>The application of force upon other people in attempting to engage in sex acts; or</li>
 	<li>Committing sexual aggression against children under 16 years old.</li>
</ul>
At trial, the prosecution must prove sexual delinquency beyond a reasonable doubt.

&nbsp;
<h3>Penalties</h3>
If a person is convicted for being a sexually delinquent person at the time of the offense, then that individual faces an indeterminate term of one day up to life in prison. However, a person would not be precluded from a sentence of probation. Additionally, this is a Tier 1 offense requiring registration under the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html">Sex Offenders Registration Act</a>, although it is possible that a sexually delinquent offender could be placed in a more serious Tier if their underlying offense was a higher Tier or if the offender has more than one Tier 1 conviction.
