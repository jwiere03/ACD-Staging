<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26048 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1953a42f-9000-49cf-937d-b27da37e686b-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" />Joshua Pease loves four things. Shoes, practicing the law, his wife, and his dogs. Although probably not in that order. His wife is an obvious one - she's lovely! And the way he goes on about his dogs you'd swear they were delivered directly from heaven. As for practicing the law, that makes perfect sense. It's what we</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> love around here! (The shoes? Well, we just don't know. Your guess is as good as ours….)</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh decided to become a lawyer in high school. He grew up in Grand Rapids, where he developed a passion for justice and the law. He started reading books about criminal justice issues, and realized that he'd received the call - he was destined to be a lawyer! Some people choose the law because it presents a challenge. Others become attorneys for the money. Josh was born to be a lawyer. It's in his blood.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">His passion is part of what makes him so good at his job. He's dedicated, driven, and committed to always doing his very best. Just ask Josh's clients. It's something they all appreciate about him. Plus, he's extremely good at explaining things to people. He breaks down every detail so that everyone's on the same page at the same time. It may not seem like a big deal at first, but the law can be very complicated. So an attorney who takes the time to make sure that you understand every part of your case is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> valuable asset, not to mention comforting. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from Western Michigan University, and getting his law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School, he spent a year working as the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney in Livingston County. After that, he went off on his own and practiced law for several years, making a name for himself as a relentless advocate for people from all walks of life. But being part of a team has definite benefits. Josh agreed to join ours, and we're so very glad that he did!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does he do when he's not practicing law? He eats apple pie and drinks whiskey (which just happen to be his two favorite food groups!) And he spends time hanging out with his wife and three dogs (obviously!) Oh, and reading! The other thing that Josh loves is books. He reads every chance he gets, and devours the written word the way a starving man devours a loaf of bread. At home he reads fantasy novels and yes, you guessed it… books about criminal justice issues.. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But reading isn't all Joshua Pease loves to do on his days off. He loves to spend time with his family. Ask him if he has children and he'll tell you yes - 3 four-legged furry ones. Ask him what he does when he's not working, and chances are, 'hanging out with his dogs' will be at the top of the list. Ask him to describe himself in five words and you won't get 'dedicated, hard working and good listener' (although they would all be accurate!) What he'd probably tell you is "perpetually covered in dog fur."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Josh grew up on Michigan's west coast, he and his wife now call the Lansing area home. However, don't let the fact that he's moved halfway across the state fool you. Josh isn't much of a traveller. In fact, if you ever ask him what his favorite vacation destination is, you'll probably get the same answer we did - "I'll let you know as soon as I take a vacation!"</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Funny as it sounds, though, it says a lot about him as a person. The fact that Josh rarely takes vacations is a testament to his work ethic and dedication. He's tireless, relentless and phenomenally hard working - all traits that have made him a valuable asset to The Kronzek Firm and to our clients. Don't misunderstand though, all that work has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made Josh a dull boy! In fact, he loves to laugh, and his quirky humor and boundless energy have made him a very popular person here at The Kronzek Firm. Josh is a blast, and we're thrilled to have him on our team!</span>
