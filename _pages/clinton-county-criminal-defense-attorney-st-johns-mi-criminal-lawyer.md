<h3><strong>Clinton County Expert Defense</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Kronzek Firm, when we take on a client, we use every available resource to build a complex and creative defense on their behalf. We analyze every piece of evidence, working together as a team, to capitalize on our strengths as attorneys. In this way, we provide you with the best and most strategic defense possible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years we have built strong professional relationships with some of the most sought-after experts in the United States. Experts in a wide variety of fields, who can provide expert testimony at a trial, if need be, and help construct a solid defense for you. There are highly respected medical experts, private investigators, and mental health professionals who are always willing to come on board when we need them. This means that your case will be stronger, better, and more skillfully crafted than many others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't leave your defense in the hands of a wet-behind-the-ears attorney who lacks the experience and knowledge to defend you properly. Nothing is worse than losing your entire future because of ignorance, inexperience, and sheer laziness on the part of your lawyer. Make the right choice today.</span>
<h3><strong>St. Johns, Michigan Legal Defense</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A guilty conviction due to inferior legal representation, or a badly managed case, can be devastating. Your future, freedom, and reputation are at stake here, not to mention your family, who will pay a high price for this tragedy. With so much on the line, you will need the best representation available. That's where we come in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have considerable experience defending people who are accused of false allegations. Whether it's <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank">murder</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank">rape</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">abuse</a>, larceny or any number of other crimes, if you didn't do it, you shouldn't be expected to pay the price.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Kronzek Firm, we are only too aware of the tragic effects of false allegations. And we have made it our personal goal to fight them at every opportunity. We have a reputation in Clinton County for handling difficult cases and taking on clients with tough charges that other defense attorneys are reluctant to handle. As your attorneys, we will fight to defend your rights and work to protect you against a wrongful conviction that could devastate your entire life.</span>
<h2><strong>The Best Clinton County Defense</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, as attorneys, we have great faith in our country's justice system, the truth is that wrongful convictions happen more often than people realize. According to the law, an individual who is accused of a crime is "innocent until proven guilty.”  Sadly, there are instances where that the system sometimes acts like that just isn't true.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the right team of attorneys defending you, even the most terrible charges can be handled professionally. Regardless of what you are facing, you don't have to do this alone. And why would you, when some of the most respected defense attorneys are only a phone call away?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right defense attorney is critical. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one have been charged with a crime, or think you are about to be charged with a crime, call our experienced defense attorneys immediately. Our phones are answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and usually you are speaking to an experienced attorney within minutes.</span>
