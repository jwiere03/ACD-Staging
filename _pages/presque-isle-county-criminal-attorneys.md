<h2>Presque Isle County Criminal Defense:</h2>
Facing serious criminal charges is not something you want to do alone. The police have ways of working around your constitutionally protected rights if they’re not aggressively asserted. From the moment of your arrest, the police and prosecutors have already begun to build a case against you. Shouldn’t you have someone building a case in your defense?

The attorneys of The Kronzek Firm PLC are ready and able to protect you against the charges that are being brought against you. Even if you haven’t been charged yet, you are still going to need attorneys who have experience dealing with Presque Isle law enforcement in order to make sure your rights are protected.

Our attorneys will work in partnership with your friends and family to make sure no detail in your case gets missed. We will work with you every step of the way, and aren’t afraid of fighting prosecutors all the way through court in Rogers City. Give your case the fighting chance it deserves, and contact the law offices of The Kronzek Firm PLC today.
