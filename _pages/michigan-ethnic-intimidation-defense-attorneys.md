<h2>Michigan Hate Crime Defense</h2>
There is a growing trend across the United States and in Michigan to categorize crimes as "hate crimes" or to consider the discriminatory motivation behind the crime.  The Michigan crime of Ethnic Intimidation is a part of that trend.    If you are facing  prosecution for Ethnic Intimidation, the Michigan criminal defense team at The Kronzek Firm can assist you.  We offer cutting edge defenses, excellent trial skills, and many years of courtroom experience to our Michigan clients.  You can contact us at (866) 766-5245.
<h2>What is Ethnic Intimidation?</h2>
Michigan law prohibits ethnic intimidation, also known as a hate crime, where a person maliciously and specifically intends to harass or intimidate another person because of his or her color, race, gender, religion, or national origin.

Specifically, a person may not do the following to the targeted person: (1) Have physical contact with that person. (2) Destroy, damage, or deface that person’s property. (3) Threaten by act or words to have physical contact with that person or to damage their property, if there is reasonable cause to believe such an act will occur.

This offense is a felony with a maximum penalty of up to 2 years in prison, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both.

Regardless of the outcome of criminal prosecution of a case, a person who suffers injury to person or property may bring a civil cause of action against an alleged perpetrator to secure actual damages including for emotional distress or an injunction. If a plaintiff prevails in the civil suit, he or she may recover damages in the amount of 3 times the actual damages, or $2,000.00, whichever is greater, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs.
