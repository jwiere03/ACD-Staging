<h3><strong>What Is An Analogue Drug?</strong></h3>
Analogue (or analog) drugs, also called designer drugs, are chemicals that are “substantially similar” to an illegal Schedule I or Schedule 2 drug. They were created specifically to replace a similar compound that had recently been banned by the federal or state government. Many were created because, in the past, state and federal drug laws only regulated the usual illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. Analogue drug users want the sensation of a drug high without the threat of the associated drug crime charge.

&nbsp;

However, now the government treats analogue drugs, if intended for human consumption, as if it is in Schedule I or Schedule 2. The Federal government’s <a href="http://www.allgov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drug Enforcement Agency</a> (DEA) has emergency scheduling power, meaning the DEA can issue a ruling that a certain designer drug immediately becomes an illegal controlled substance. Once this occurs, state governments usually follow suit and pass laws making that analogue drug illegal in their state. The Michigan Legislature recently passed a law making synthetic Marijuana and other analogue drugs illegal Schedule I controlled substances.

<h3><strong>Are Analogue Drugs Legal?</strong></h3>
No. As designer drugs gain popularity, the government has taken notice. Both federal and state government now heavily regulate analogue drugs. If you are charged with a crime involving an analogue drug, penalties can be just as severe as common street drug charges. Because of this, you need a skilled Michigan drug crime lawyer to represent your legal rights in court. Each analogue drug mimics the chemical makeup of a certain illicit drug.

&nbsp;

For example, alpha-Methylfentanyl, or China White, is a popular designer drug for Heroin. Highs obtained from using China White are the same, or as strong, as Heroin highs. There are many health concerns that accompany analogue drug use. These include easy overdose potential, stopped breathing and possible death. Drug screens tend to test for the more common drugs allowing analogue drugs to often go undetected. This creates problems for drug treatment centers, probation officers and parole workers. Drug test manufacturers are working hard to create tests that will identify these drugs in a user’s system.

<h3><strong>Michigan Analogue Drug Laws</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Use of Analog Drugs in Michigan:</strong>
Analogue Drug use is a misdemeanor in Michigan. If convicted of this crime, sentencing results can be jail for up to one year, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.</li>
 	<li><strong>Possession of Analogue Drugs in Michigan:</strong>
Possession of an Analogue Drug is a felony in Michigan. If found guilty of this crime, sentencing results can be prison for up to two years, a fine of up to $2,000, or both.</li>
 	<li><strong>Delivery or Manufacturing of Analogue Drugs in Michigan:</strong>
Creation, manufacture, delivery, intent to deliver or possession of an Analogue Drug are all felony drug crimes in Michigan. If convicted of any of these crimes, sentencing could be prison for up to 15 years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

As with any other drug crime, sentencing could be more severe if the Analogue Drugs were delivered to a minor or within a certain distance of a school, house, business, park, or church.

Sentencing will also likely be more severe if this is not the first drug conviction. A conviction for a designer drug crime will result in Driver’s License suspension and payment of fines to the State of Michigan. Michigan police, prosecutors, and judges take Analogue Drug crimes very seriously, and you should, too. You may think that law enforcement will overlook your Analogue Drug crime because it was not a drug crime involving one of the more common drugs, however, this is not at all the case.
