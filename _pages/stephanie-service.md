<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26060 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SMS-2.27.14-240x300-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" />The year was 2005. The place: a dark little restaurant in West Virginia, during a family reunion dinner. Stephanie Service was tucking into a club sandwich, when her Grandpa leaned over and asked her what she wanted to do with her life. Her answer? "The usual - get a job, get married, have kids." His response? "You should think about law school."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she thought the idea was somewhat ridiculous at the time, Stephanie made a promise that day. She promised her grandpa that she would at least think about it. And one of the many things about Stephanie that makes her such a reliable and steadfast person it the fact that she keeps her promises. And so she did - she thought it over, and the more she thought about it, the more it seemed like a good idea. Which actually doesn't begin to cover it - it was a fantastic idea! </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So off she went, to Western Michigan University’s Cooley Law School where, after first getting a degree at Grand Valley State University, she graduated in the top 5% of her class. It was this dedication and work ethic that helps make her the great attorney she is now. That and her listening skills. In fact, ask any of Stephanie's clients and they'll tell you - one of her greatest attributes is that she's a good listener. That, combined with her strong work ethic, her empathy, and undying loyalty to those she commits to, make her one of the most sought-after attorneys in the area. But you can figure that out by yourself by just reading the rave online reviews from her clients. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie isn't all work and no play, though! When she isn't line dancing and doing DIY projects around her house, she can be found getting creative at local painting classes, where she gets a little better each time. Oh, and she loves watching bad reality TV. No, not those goofy sitcoms that everyone enjoys when they need a brain-break, we're talking about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bad reality TV. The kind that most people won't admit to. But don't worry, she likes to get out and about as well, sampling craft beers from local breweries, and taking nature walks with her family.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Stephanie takes "out and about" to a whole new level. With a globe-trotting resume that includes France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy and most recently a small cabin in Colorado - she's a veritable adventurer. But ask her what adventure she enjoys most and she'll tell you - being a mom. For someone who wasn't even sure she wanted kids, having her son was a life-changing event for Stephanie and her husband. It put everything else into perspective. In fact, motherhood helps her relate to her clients on a more personal level, which she says makes her a better defense lawyer. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a parent helps you understand the struggles that clients endure when their own families are threatened. It provides you with a unique perspective into the fears they face, and helps you empathize with their individual situations. Stephanie understands the fears, uncertainty and fright that people feel when they’ve been accused of a crime and are fighting for their freedom. That’s why Stephanie Service is so dedicated to her clients. She understands their struggles, feels their pain, and knows personally how hard this process can be. But it's also why she fights so hard, and gives every case she takes on her unyielding dedication. Because families are important, and she loves helping people protect their own.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie is a 'live life to the fullest" kind of person, and she brings that same spiritedness to everything she does. Whether it's salmon fishing on Lake Michigan, trying new and unusual foods, or standing in front of a judge battling in defense of a someone accused of a crime, Stephanie's passion is unmistakable. It's one of the reasons she's such a great lawyer, and why we're so proud to have her on The Kronzek Firm’s team.</span>
