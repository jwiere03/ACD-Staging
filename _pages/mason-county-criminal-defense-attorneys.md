<h2>Mason County Criminal Lawyers</h2>
<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/iStock_000000919578_Large.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5637" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/iStock_000000919578_Large-300x200.jpg" alt="man arrested with handcuffs" width="300" height="200" /></a>When you need a Mason County criminal defense attorney, The Kronzek Firm is immediately available to help. Clients and family members can <a title="Contact us online" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us">contact us online</a>, or call our 24/7 hotline at <strong>1-866-7NOJAIL</strong> to speak with one of our attorneys.  We take all criminal  charges seriously, and we strive to provide every client with the intense, focused personal attention that they need and deserve.  Whether your case involves drugs, sexual assault, internet crimes, economic or property crimes or any serious felony, we can help.
<h2>Help With Your Ludington Case</h2>
If you've been arrested or charged with a felony in Mason County, Michigan, then you need an aggressive criminal attorney on your side.  If you are being investigated for a crime, don't wait to be arrested to call for help.  Police often deliberately violate your rights, including your right to remain silent and your right to an attorney.  Our attorneys are experts at turning those violations into viable defenses.
<h2>Mason County CSC Defense</h2>
The attorneys of The Kronzek Firm PLC have successfully defended Criminal Sexual Conduct cases throughout Michigan.  We have seen many, many cases where clients were being railroaded because of a lack of aggressive and competent defense counsel.  Don't let this happen to you.  Although Michigan does not recognize CSC defense as a "specialty," our clients benefit from the fact that we do CSC defense every day.  Some firms are better at marketing than they are at defending difficult cases.  Our vision is to provide the very best defense possible to every client.  This dedication shows up in our <a title="Proven Results" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results">results</a>.  We have successfully defended cases with DNA evidence and cases with child allegations.  The resources that we have available to us are second to none.
<h2>Mason County Drug Crime Defense</h2>
Defending drug cases can be particularly challenging because many drug arrests follow police tactics that are unfair, dishonest and infringe on your state and federal constitutional rights.  You will need an attorney who is comfortable taking on an unfair system.  We have had extensive success in our drug crime defense practice.  If we can help you, don't hesitate to call our toll free number.  We offer consultations in your home for qualifying clients.
