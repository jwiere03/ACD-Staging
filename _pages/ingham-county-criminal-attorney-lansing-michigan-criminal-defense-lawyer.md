Providing the best possible defense representation for the people of Lansing, East Lansing, Mason, Williamston, and Leslie.
<h2><strong>The Best Ingham County Criminal Defense Choice</strong></h2>
<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ingham-Hall-of-Justice.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-7173" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ingham-Hall-of-Justice-300x200.jpg" alt="Ingham County- Hall of Justice" width="305" height="203" /></a>When faced with criminal charges in Ingham County, whether seemingly minor or very serious, you are going to need an experienced and well-respected defense attorney working to defend you. At The Kronzek Firm, we are equipped to handle every aspect of your criminal case, ensuring that your rights are protected and your defense helps to provide the best possible outcome.

Trying to navigate the criminal justice system alone puts you at risk. Without aggressive representation, you are at the mercy of prosecutors who are often more concerned with getting a conviction than seeking justice. Our skilled defense attorneys are concerned with nothing other than protecting your rights, and providing you with the most advantageous resolution for your case.

We have the resources, the skills, and the tenacity to defend you against even the most serious charges. Because we are located right in Lansing, we are immediately available to clients in Ingham County.
<h4><strong>Lansing's Best Defense Against Criminal Charges</strong></h4>
Facing criminal charges is very serious, and can have a devastating impact on your life. It doesn't have to be a serious charge in order to have a huge impact on your life and the lives of your family. Even crimes that may seem insignificant can have a lasting effect on your future.

A conviction in Ingham County most often becomes part of your permanent criminal record. This can hamper your chances of getting a good job in the future. Additionally, if you are convicted later of another crime, the court can consider you a repeat offender, and impose a harsher sentence with your newest sentence.

At The Kronzek Firm, we have a very skilled and experienced team of attorneys. When we take on a client, we use every available resource, combined with our many years of experience, to build a complex and creative defense for them. We analyze every piece of evidence, and work together as a team, capitalizing on our strengths to provide you with the best and most strategic defense possible.

<h4>False Accusation Defense Attorneys</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">False accusations are terrifying. The words are enough to give anyone a serious case of the jitters. After all, we've all read accounts in the paper of people accused of crimes in order to deflect blame, or because the prosecutor settles for the easiest answer, even if it's the wrong one.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is more tragic than someone being convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and being sentenced to prison to serve time they don't deserve. But sadly, this happens more often than most people realize.
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of a guilty conviction because of inferior legal representation, or a badly managed case, can be devastating. Your future, your freedom, and your reputation are at stake. With so much on the line, you will need the best representation available. That's where we come in.</span>
<h4><strong>Choose The Best Ingham County Criminal Attorney</strong></h4>
Criminal charges can be extremely upsetting to the family and loved ones of the accused. Between the police showing up at your home, and the media splashing the details of your personal life around, it can be very stressful for everyone involved. And that's not even taking into account possible time in prison, thousands of dollars in fines, and the damaging effect on your future.

Choosing the right defense attorney is critical. If you or a loved one have been charged with a crime, or think you are about to be charged with a crime, call our experienced defense attorneys immediately. Our phones are answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and usually you are speaking to an experienced attorney within minutes.

Don't wait. And don't make the mistake of thinking that just any attorney can handle your situation. Many people currently serving time in prison have made the mistake of assuming that the charges will "go away" once the prosecutor realizes that they're false. Or that any attorney can provide an excellent defense. Because, unfortunately, that just isn't the case.
