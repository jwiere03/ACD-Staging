<h2>Howell, Michigan Sex Crime Defense</h2>
<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20140929_162154.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5669 size-medium" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/20140929_162154-300x168.jpg" alt="Howell Police Department Vehicle" width="300" height="168" /></a>Finding the best Howell CSC attorney to may not be an easy task.  Many attorneys make claims based on their years of practice or close relationships with judges and prosecutors.  A criminal sexual conduct lawyer, especially one who knows how to defend  child allegation case, is actually not that common.  You need to look below the surface and find an attorney whose training and experience will benefit you.  Here are some questions that you should ask of any law firm that you are looking at:
<ul>
	<li>Have you ever tried and won a CSC case?</li>
	<li>Have you ever tried and won DNA / CSC cases?</li>
	<li>Have you ever tried and won child allegation cases?</li>
	<li>Have you ever tried and won cases with "other acts"  or 404b witnesses?</li>
	<li>Do you have any special training in forensic interview protocols?</li>
</ul>
Our team would answer a resounding "Yes!" to all of these questions.  We understand how to defend rape cases, statutory rape cases, child pornography cases, and every type of criminal sexual conduct cases in Livingston County and throughout Michigan.

Cronkright</span>

Michael Cronkright has been defending CSC cases since before he founded The Kronzek Firm along with Chuck Kronzek.  He has a wide variety of trial experience which includes criminal defense and CPS defense.  He has defended all degrees of CSC cases and has won complicated DNA cases, as well as child allegation cases and multiple victims cases.

Because of his experience with Children's Protective Services matters, Mr. Cronkright is often involved in our cases which involve both police and CPS investigations.  The Children's Protective Services office in Howell is understaffed and in many instances staffed by under-qualified or incompetent investigators.  The consequences for families can be devastating.    Mr. Cronkright is passionate about defending families from accusations that result from inept investigations.
