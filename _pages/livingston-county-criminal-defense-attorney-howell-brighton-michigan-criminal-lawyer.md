<h3><strong>Howell - Brighton Criminal Defense</strong></h3>
A criminal record can hamper your chances of getting a good job, and do lasting damage to your reputation within your community. In addition, a criminal record can leave you with a terrible social stigma that is almost impossible to get away from. Having a criminal record can change the way people view you and, as a result, affect all of your future relationships. And if that isn't harsh enough? There is also prison time, and exorbitant fines and fees to consider. Which is why you need an excellent attorney; one who can provide you with an excellent defense.

We regularly defend our clients against all types of charges and allegations, which can include: <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank">murder</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank">rape</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">assault</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank">armed robbery</a>, fraud, larceny, arson, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank">embezzlement</a>, drug charges and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felony firearm</a>.

<h3><strong>Defending Livingston County's Falsely Accused</strong></h3>
False allegations aren't just something that happens in movies. They happen in real life, right here in Livingston County.  And it's real people whose lives are damaged as a result. Although our justice system was put in place to punish individuals who break the law, the truth is that wrongful convictions happen more often than many people realize, or are even willing to admit. Although the law says that anyone accused of a crime is "innocent until proven guilty", sadly, there are sometimes circumstances where that isn't true.

Sometimes it's because someone at fault wants to pass along the blame, hoping that if they point the finger at someone else they won't get caught. Sometimes it has to do with revenge and personal vendettas. And sometimes it's simply a case of the investigators doing a poor job.

At The Kronzek Firm, we are aware of the tragic effects of false allegations and we have made it our personal goal to fight hard and get excellent results for our clients. We have a reputation in Livingston County for handling difficult cases and taking on clients with tough charges that other defense attorneys are reluctant to handle. As your attorneys, we will fight to defend your rights and work to protect you against a wrongful conviction that could devastate your entire life.
