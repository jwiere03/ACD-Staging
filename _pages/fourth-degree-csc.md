<h2>Fourth Degree CSC Defense</h2>
Criminal Sexual Conduct, also called CSC, is the name of a group of crimes under Michigan law designed to punish those defendants accused of doing something wrong of a sexual nature. There are four degrees of CSC offense in Michigan. Fourth degree CSC is the least serious of those offenses but still has life-long, life-changing consequences. In all CSC cases, the <a style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html">sex offender registry</a>, jail and prison, fines and costs, along with probation or parole are real considerations. We can help. Our attorneys have <a style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html">successfully defended</a> CSC cases for close to 20 years.

&nbsp;
<h2>4th Degree CSC | Sexual Contact</h2>
The definition of sexual contact is different that the definition of sexual penetration.  "Sexual contact" includes the intentional touching of the victim's or actor's intimate parts or the intentional touching of the clothing covering the immediate area of the victim's or actor's intimate parts, if that intentional touching can reasonably be construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, done for a sexual purpose, or in a sexual manner for:
<div class="mini-width">
<ul>
 	<li>(i) Revenge.</li>
 	<li>(ii) To inflict humiliation.</li>
 	<li>(iii) Out of anger.</li>
</ul>
</div>
Naturally, not all sexual contact with another person would be considered a crime. There has to be sexual contact plus something else. In the case of CSC fourth degree, that “something else” includes things like: the presence of force or coercion, the accuser being age 13 up to 16 with the defendant being more than 5 years older than the accuser, the defendant knowing or ought to know that the victim is mentally or physically incapacitated, the defendant being a mental health professional who treated the accuser within the last two years, and more.

&nbsp;
<h2>Penalties for CSC 4</h2>
Criminal Sexual Conduct in the fourth degree is what is called a high-court misdemeanor, which is an offense that in name-only is considered a misdemeanor but for all intents and purposes is a felony charge. The maximum punishment is 2 years in prison and a $500 fine. Also, if convicted, the defendant may be placed on Michigan’s sex offender registry for up to life in certain circumstances, unless the offender qualifies for an early removal.

Defending CSC charges is a job for an expert CSC attorney. A CSC defense attorney is often facing a hostile and emotional prosecutor and judge. It takes a lawyer skilled in the art of cross examination and prepared to confront adversarial witnesses. Because no two cases are alike, a great defense in one case may not be viable in another case. However, some main examples of CSC defense include: “It was not the defendant, but someone else,” “the accuser consented to the sexual activity,” “it did not happen like the accuser claims,” “there was contact, but it was not sexual” and, “it did not happen at all.” People often tell us, “There is not evidence in my case.” However, the most common evidence on which defendants are convicted is the testimony of an alleged victim. This should never be taken lightly.

We know the prosecutor’s office has a tendency to over-charge CSC cases, and we are not afraid to fight that over-charging. We advise our clients of what we think would be the best way to fight their cases, but we also are very open to hearing what our clients want to do. After all, we work for you. The <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html">trial attorneys</a> at The Kronzek Firm are generally available 24/7 for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html">free initial consultations</a>.
