<h3>We Push Back.</h3>
For nearly 20 years, we have been pushing back.  Generally, we don't allow CPS in your home without an attorney present, we don't recommend that clients sign anything without us reviewing it first.  We don't recommend clients take drug tests without talking to us.  We don't allow CPS to bring police with them into your home.  We don't recommend that clients give access to confidential information without first having a viable strategy in place to get CPS out of your life.

&nbsp;
<h3>No, You Don't have to Let CPS . . .</h3>
Every day, we get phone calls from people that want to ask questions that start like this.  The short answer is almost always NO!   But that is often the WRONG QUESTION.  In many instances the better question starts with "SHOULD  I . . ."   This is where we come in. Once we are on board, helping your family, we will work together to build strategies to get CPS out of your home.  We will build strategies designed to make the  better and not worse.

&nbsp;
<h3>Your Family Circumstances Matter</h3>
For most questions that parents have, there are no standard answers.  Your situation will definitely affect the advice we give you.  Fortunately for you, we have been down this road with many, many families and have an excellent record of keeping families together and getting CPS, prosecutors , judges and courts out of our client's lives.

&nbsp;
<h3>We Only Represent Parents and Caregivers.</h3>
Our role in Neglect and Abuse cases is always the same, we don't do court appointed cases and we only represent the parents and caregivers.  We are dedicated parent advocates and believe in our clients.  Our passion for keeping families together, our experience and our professionalism make a difference to our clients.

&nbsp;
