Knowledgeable, attentive representation is vital if you are in the unfortunate position of facing criminal charges. That is why our Kent County attorneys continuously update themselves on changes in the law and effective methods of defending clients. The Kronzek Firm PLC aggressively represents clients accused of felony and misdemeanor charges in Grand Rapids, East Grand Rapids, Grandville, Cedar Springs, and Kentwood.
<h2><strong>Grand Rapids Criminal Lawyers</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being charged with a crime is one of the most frightening things a person can experience. In addition to the fear and stress that comes with being investigated and charged with a crime, there is the issue of your future. Criminal charges can be devastating to a person's future. Robbing you of your freedom, privacy and chances at a normal life. But it doesn't have to be that way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Kronzek Firm we have the skill, experience, and dogged tenacity required to go head-to-head with the Kent County Prosecutor's Office. With decades of combined experience, we are your best defense. Effectively defending clients both in and out of court, and the resources to ensure that your case gets unrivaled representation.
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As clients our clients, you will be treated with dignity and respect. We do not judge, and unlike the police and the media, do not treat our clients as if they are guilty. As your attorneys we will provide you with guidance, legal protection, and an excellent defense during this time of hardship and stress.</span>
<h3><strong>Competent Kent County Trial Attorneys</strong></h3>
We take great pride in being able to walk our clients through every stage of the defense process. This allows them to participate in every aspect of their own defense. As our client, you will receive:
<ul>
 	<li>A full explanation of all the charges you are facing</li>
 	<li>An explanation of the entire process, as the case unfolds</li>
 	<li>Descriptions of very one of your options, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each choice available to you</li>
 	<li>Honesty in all of our dealings with you</li>
 	<li>Compassion for the difficult place that you are in</li>

 	<li>A relationship based on mutual trust and respect</li>
 	<li>The most strategic and creative defense we can provide for you</li>
</ul>
Until you have professional legal representation, it is our advice that you not discuss any aspect of your case with the police, or with any other emplo<img class="alignleft wp-image-7320" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Kent-62-3-D-Ct-300x225.jpg" alt="Kent County- 62-3 D Ct" width="364" height="273" />yees from other agencies. Don't deny anything, don't proclaim your innocence, and don't answer any questions. Just be polite and courteous, but refuse to discuss anything at all until your attorney is present. Remaining silent is a right afforded to you by the law.

We also suggest that you not discuss anything pertaining to your case with your friends or relatives, regardless of how badly you feel the need to explain your side of the story or want their sympathy. Even if they openly support you and refuse to accept the allegations made against you, silence is the best possible option. Words can be twisted by prosecutors, and people can be forced to testify against you in court.

<h3><strong>Defending Against False Accusations</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">False accusations happen more often than many people realize. Which is terrifying, when you stop and think about it. That's an area in which we have substantially more practice than our competitors. Making us one of the premier law firms sought out by people facing false accusations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is more tragic than someone being convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and being sentenced to prison to serve time they don't deserve. So if you are charged with a crime you didn't commit, you need to contact us immediately. Don't wait. And don't let an inferior legal representation land you behind bars.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kent County, we have a reputation for handling difficult cases. We take on clients faced with some of the toughest charges, that other defense attorneys are often reluctant to handle. We have a reputation of gaining victories for our clients, often against great odds. We will fight to protect your rights, and to defend you against a devastating wrongful conviction.</span>
