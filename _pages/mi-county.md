<h2>Services in all Counties of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula:</h2>
With nearly 100 years of combined experience, our Michigan trial attorneys are familiar with the legal systems and courts unique to each of the counties of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. The Kronzek Firm PLC attorneys will work with you, helping you negotiate the legal process and helping you understand how your case will be handled in your county’s circuit, district, or probate court.

Our state wide Criminal Defense Team covers all counties in the lower peninsula, including <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/allegan.html">Allegan County</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/barry.html">Barry County</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/berrien.html">Berrien County</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/branch.html">Branch County</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cass.html">Cass County</a>, <a href="http://thecleanteam.xyz/chippewa.html">Chippewa County</a>, <a href="http://thecleanteam.xyz/genesee.html">Genesee County</a>, <a href="http://thecleanteam.xyz/gratiot.html">Gratiot County</a>, <a href="http://thecleanteam.xyz/hillsdale.html">Hillsdale County</a>, Huron County, Iron County, Jackson County, Kalamazoo County, Lapeer County, Lenawee County, Oceana County, Saginaw County, St. Clair County, St. Joseph County, Sanillac County, Shiawassee County, Tuscola County, Van Buren County,  and Washtenaw County.

Being accused of a felony or misdemeanor can be distressing, and you should not try to make sense if it alone. You need someone on your side who is familiar with the courts, the judges, and the laws in your county. Our attorneys will analyze the evidence and review the details of the police investigation. Police make mistakes, and the smallest details can mean the difference between a dismissed case and a lengthy jail sentence.

At The Kronzek Firm PLC, we stay up to date on Michigan’s laws, including the quickly changing laws regarding sex crimes, drug crimes, and drunk driving. You can visit our <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/blog/">blog</a> to read our insightful analysis of some of these legal issues.

You should contact us immediately if you’re concerned that you may be charged with a crime. Whether you’re facing drug crimes, sex crimes, property crimes, or crimes involving vehicles, we can help. We will aggressively defend your constitutional rights, we will work hard to protect your reputation, and we will fight for the best possible outcome.
