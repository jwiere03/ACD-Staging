<h5><b>Oakland County Criminal Defense Attorneys Defending Your Rights</b></h5>
Criminal charges can be for either felony crimes, or misdemeanors. While misdemeanors are often considered less significant because their penalties are less severe, don't make the mistake of thinking that you don't need to invest in an aggressive defense. Months of jail time and thousands in fines and fees can cost you a great deal both now and in the future.

Under Michigan law, felony crimes are the most serious crimes, and can carry very severe punishments, depending upon the conviction. Someone convicted of a felony could end up in prison for the rest of their life if their case is mismanaged, or they are poorly represented.

We are skilled and dedicated professionals with many years of combined experience defending individuals accused of crimes in Oakland County. During this time of hardship and stress, it is critical to make certain that you are protected, and that your rights are not being violat<img class="alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/images/county-img7.jpg" alt="Oakland County Criminal Defense- Criminal Courtroom" width="304" height="207" />ed.
