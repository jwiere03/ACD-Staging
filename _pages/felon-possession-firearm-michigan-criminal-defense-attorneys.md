<h2><b>Expert Michigan Criminal Attorneys</b></h2>
Those convicted of serious crimes have repaid their debt to society when their sentence is over and probation or parole has ended.  Most are now looking to rebuild their lives and move on. However, this may prove difficult at times if you have a felony on your record and feel like you have to live life looking over your shoulder.   Worrying about potential charges of unlawful gun possession is a troubling aspect of being a felon. The fact is that when convicted of a felony, a person will lose his or her right to bear arms for a set period of time. If you are facing felon in possession charges, you need a team of sharp and talented attorneys that know how to successfully defend  you. The trial lawyers at The Kronzek Firm PLC, have nearly 100 years of total experience dealing with gun charges and with all major felonies.
<h2><b>About the Crime of Felon in Possession</b></h2>
<h3>Felonies Carrying a Three Year Suspension</h3>
A person convicted of a felony cannot possess, sell, use, transport, purchase, ship, carry, receive, or distribute guns or ammunition until the after 3 years after all of the following conditions are met. First, the individual has paid all imposed fines associated with the crime. Next, all terms of imprisonment have been served. Finally, all terms of parole or probation are successfully completed.
<h3>Felonies Carrying a Five Year Suspension</h3>
An individual convicted of certain felonies cannot engage in the above-mentioned gun-related activities until after 5 years have passed and until specific circumstances exist. Again, all fines must be paid first. Also, all jail time must be served. Third, all probation and parole conditions must be completed as well.

These specified felonies are ones that include one or more of the following elements. First is that the crime involves the use, attempted use, or threats of physical force against another person or his or her property. This also includes offenses that have a substantial risk of such violence occurring during the commission of the crime. In addition, crimes that involve possession, distribution, and more, related to controlled substances are included. Furthermore, crimes that involve unlawful distribution or possession of a gun are covered as well. Another example is a felony that involves the unlawful use of explosives such as bombs. Or, felonies that involve breaking and entering into an occupied home, related burglaries, or arson.

After the listed conditions are satisfied, then the person’s gun rights may be restored.  <strong>Note  that this is not an automatic reinstatement of your gun rights.  You must still take appropriate action with the local gun board.</strong>
<h3><b>Penalties for Felon in Possession of a Firearm</b></h3>
If at any point a felon who has not had his/her rights restored, possesses, uses, purchases, sells, carries, ships, distributes, or receives guns or ammunition, they may be charged with a felony. The maximum penalty is up to 5 years in prison, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both.
