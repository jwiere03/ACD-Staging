<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firearm crimes and weapons charges are taken very seriously by Michigan prosecutors and judges particularly in areas with a high crime rate. Conviction can result in years of prison time, probation and high fines. Inexperienced attorneys can cost you your freedom. Barely a day goes by that our criminal defense doesn’t get a phone call from the family of a defendant facing mandatory prison time after having been convicted of some gun charge. Sometimes the convictions are in state court and other times there are federal convictions. In the end, people are headed off to prison after being convicted of weapons charges. </span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b>Firearm Charges</b>

Under Michigan law, the illegal use of a firearm or other weapon can carry very harsh penalties including jail or prison time. Federal penalties are usually more harsh than state penalties.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several different crimes that fall into the category of firearms charges, which include the following:</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Carrying a Concealed Weapon</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying a concealed weapon without a license, or in a manner inconsistent with licensing regulations, is a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and substantial fines. For more information about concealed weapons, please </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Illegal Discharge of a Weapon</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even registered, legal gun owners can be charged for what is deemed "reckless" or "unsafe" firing of that weapon. Firing a gun to celebrate a holiday, inside a building or in a crowded area can all result in being charged with illegal discharge of a weapon. For more information about illegal discharge of a weapon, please </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Illegal Possession of a Firearm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal possession of a firearm can refer to several instances. Carrying a concealed gun without a concealed carry permit or concealed pistol license (CPL) is one example. Another would be having a gun if you have a felony on your criminal record, or carrying a gun at the time that you commit a separate, unrelated, felony crime. For more information about illegal possession of a firearm, please </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Felon in Possession of a Firearm</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan a convicted felon is forbidden from carrying a gun unless they have undergone a very strict process to have their gun rights restored. A felon found in possession of a gun is subject to felony charges.

&nbsp;

<b>Possession of Firearms on Certain Premises</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is against Michigan law to carry a gun into certain buildings, including courthouses, post offices, schools and hospitals. This prohibition extends even to those that have a lawful CPL. Doing so can result in misdemeanor charges and jail time of up to 90 days. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Carrying a Dangerous Weapon with Unlawful Intent</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone is found to possess a weapon, including a gun, that they intended to use in the commission of a crime, they could be charged with this crime. It is a very serious felony punishable by up to five years in prison, with possible fines.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Illegal Weapons:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all weapons are guns. Knives, pepper spray and tasers are examples of these. But not all weapons are legal in Michigan, and anyone found carrying a prohibited weapon is subject to  serious felony charges. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Felony Firearm</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Felony firearm refers to the crime of carrying a firearm at the time that you are committing, or attempting to commit, another felony. Felony firearm is a separate felony charge in addition to the charge for whatever other felony crime you are accused of committing. As a result, it often results in a separate conviction that means additional, MANDATORY prison time for a defendant, if not handled properly by an experienced defense attorney. That mandatory prison time is served in addition to, or consecutive to, prison time for the other felony convictions.

&nbsp;

<b>Restoration of Gun Rights</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process involved in restoring a person's gun rights is determined by the situation in which they were initially revoked. Before you can begin the process, however, your eligibility for both federal and state gun rights restoration will need to be determined. Working with our NRA referral attorney can help you determine exactly what is involved in your particular case, and get you back on the road to legal gun ownership in Michigan.

&nbsp;

<b>Weapons Charges</b>

Guns are not the only weapons that can result in charges under Michigan law. However, the use of knives, brass knuckles, baseball bats and other items that are not guns but are considered to be "dangerous weapons", are charged under different statutes.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That does not mean, however, that these are not also treated as very serious charges.  Depending on the circumstances, these charges could include </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault with a Dangerous Weapon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestic Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed Robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disarming a Corrections Officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
