<h2>Sex Crime Defense Lawyers</h2>
Date Rape is a lay term that is not really used in Michigan's sex offense statutes.  Generally, date rape is where a person forces unwanted sexual contact on another in a dating context. It often involves the use of drugs which reduce the resistance of a person to sexual advances or makes them incapable of consenting to sexual interaction.    The experienced Michigan CSC defense attorneys have successfully handled Criminal Sexual Conduct trails for nearly two decades.
<h3>GBH and other Date Rape Drugs</h3>
In some instances, these cases involve date rape drugs such as Rohypnol or “roofies,” and GHB. Furthermore, a person could be slipped a mickey with any other number of drugs that may cause short-term memory loss. After ingesting the drug, the person would be unable to ward off the sexual advances. If such a drug shows up on lab results of an alleged victim of a sexual assault, it can lend support to an allegation that the sexual contact was not consented to.
<h3><strong>What if I have been falsely accused of date rape?</strong></h3>
The trial lawyers at The Kronzek Firm PLC, have nearly one hundred years of combined court room experience defending rape charges. We pride ourselves on providing thorough, detailed, and aggressive defense to clients statewide.  It is important to remember that in any rape case, the prosecution must prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

There are many reasons why false accusations may arise. Some examples include getting caught having an affair; remorse over the sexual encounter due to the influence of drugs or alcohol; the accuser wants to get revenge over disintegration of the romantic relationship; and more.

In addition, it is very important to have highly experienced criminal defense lawyers by your side as rape is such an emotionally-charged topic. Police may want to take an accuser’s story at face value regarding consent. Moreover, police are crime solvers that are allowed to lie to get results. An accused person should never talk with police about rape allegations without an attorney present.

Proving consent or lack thereof can be full of complexities and ambiguities. While the affirmative defense of consent has been established by case law, there are many reasons why this defense may be unavailable. The quality of legal advocacy and investigation on your behalf can make all the difference in whether a jury fully hears your side of the story or not.
<h3>Michigan Rape Shield</h3>
Moreover, Michigan has a rape-shield law that limits how a defense lawyer can confront an accuser at trial. For instance, specific evidence or opinion of the accuser’s past sexual conduct and reputation may not be admitted unless the judge finds it to be material to a fact at issue and not overly prejudicial. This includes evidence of past sexual contact with the defendant and also of specific instances of penetration demonstrating a source of pregnancy, semen, or disease.
