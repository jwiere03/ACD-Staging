<h3><strong>Breaking and Entering a Vehicle to Steal Property</strong></h3>
An individual breaking and entering into one of the above-mentioned types of motor vehicles to steal or unlawfully remove property may be criminally charged.

If the value of the stolen property is less than $200.00, then the defendant may be charged with a misdemeanor that has a maximum penalty up to 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or 3 times the value of the property value, whichever is greater, or both.

For a value of $200.00 through $1,000.00—or if the property value is less than $200.00 and<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/iStock_000009705428_Large-e1400967055347.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-4232 size-medium" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/iStock_000009705428_Large-199x300.jpg" alt="Car thief" width="199" height="300" /></a> there is 1 or more prior conviction under this section or a substantially similar local ordinance—then the defendant may be charged with a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty up to 1 year in jail, a fine up to $2,000.00, or 3 times the value of the property, whichever is greater, or both.

If the value is between $1,000.00 and $20,000.00—or the property value is between $200.00 and $1,000.00 and there is 1 or more prior conviction—then the defendant may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty up to 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or 3 times the value of the property, whichever is greater, or both.

Regarding a value over $20,000.00—or $1,000.00 to $20,000.00 plus 2 or more prior convictions—this is a felony with a maximum penalty up to 10 years in prison, a fine up to $15,000.00, or 3 times the value of the property, whichever is greater, or both.
<h3><strong>Vehicle Destruction in Conjunction with Theft</strong></h3>
An individual who steals personal property from a vehicle with:
<ul>
	<li>A value less than $200.00;</li>
	<li>Property value $200.00 to $1,000.00; or</li>
	<li>If the property value is under $200.00 and there is 1 or more prior conviction under this section or a substantially similar local ordinance; and</li>
	<li>Cuts, tears, breaks, or damages any part of a motor vehicle, trailer, house trailer, or semitrailer in the process.</li>
</ul>
Then, the defendant may be charged with a felony with a maximum penalty up to 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or both, regardless of the value of the property.

Additionally, the values of stolen property may be added together over a 12-month period to determine the total value of the property stolen through a common scheme or course of conduct.
