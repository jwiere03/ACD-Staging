<h3><strong>Battle Creek, Michigan Criminal Defense</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Calhoun-Sheriff.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-7374 size-medium" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Calhoun-Sheriff-300x225.jpg" alt="Calhoun County Sheriff" width="300" height="225" /></a>Being charged with a crime in Calhoun County is one of the most frightening challenges you are likely to face in life. It can be stressful and frightening, for both you and your loved ones. This is why you need a tenacious, aggressive, and hard working defense attorney representing you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Kronzek Firm, we are all of that and more. We have a very skilled and experienced team of attorneys ready to fight for you. When we take on a client, we use every available resource to construct a complex and creative defense. We analyze every piece of evidence, hire the best expert witnesses, and retain the most highly qualified investigators in defense of our clients. Hiring the best means that you get the best.
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rying to navigate the criminal justice system without an excellent defense attorney puts you at risk. Without aggressive representation, you are at the mercy of prosecutors. Many of whom are more concerned with conviction rates than justice. Our skilled defense attorneys are concerned with nothing other than protecting your rights, and providing the highest quality defense available in Calhoun County.</span>
<h3><strong>Our Expert Attorneys Make a Difference</strong></h3>
We know what you're up against and what's at stake - your future, family, and freedom. We will work hard to get the best possible outcome for each case we take on.

A criminal conviction in Michigan usually becomes a part of your permanent record. This can ruin your chances of getting a good job in the future, and even have a negative effect on future relationships. Additionally, if you are convicted of another crime later on, having a criminal record will cause the court to consider you as a repeat offender, likely result in harsher sentences.

This is why it is so important that you have the best possible defense attorney working for you. Don't make the mistake of thinking that any attorney can handle your situation. Many people currently behind bars have made that same mistake, and have paid for it with their freedom.

Choosing the right defense attorney is critical. If you or a loved one have been charged with a crime, or think you are about to be charged, call our experienced defense attorneys immediately. Our phones are answered 24/7, and you are usually speaking to an experienced attorney within minutes.

The words alone raise fear in people. It's a terrifying thought. This, along with the realization that they happen quite often is even scarier.
