<h3>Antrim County Criminal Lawyers</h3>
Do you need the assistance of an expert Antrim County criminal attorney?  Are you being charged with a crime in Antrim County?  The Kronzek Firm PLC offers expert criminal defense attorneys and immediate assistance.

There are a couple things you need to know if you want to stand up to police and prosecutors. The first is that it is almost never a good idea to speak to police without an attorney present. Many people don’t know that police are allowed to lie to you, often getting you to believe that cooperating with them will help your situation. But as you are informed when read your Miranda rights, your statements to police can be used against you in court.

The second thing that you need to know is that you’re going to need a team of attorneys in Antrim on your side whose practice focuses on criminal defense. The attorneys of The Kronzek Firm PLC have around 100 years of combined experience fighting virtually all types of criminal cases. We’ve defended clients all across Michigan’s Lower Peninsula, and are ready to defend you in Antrim’s 13th Circuit Court and its 86th District Court.

Don’t trust your case to a court-appointed attorney or an attorney timid about standing up for your rights. Many Antrim lawyers won’t give your case the time and attention needed to win in court. If you want your case in experienced and capable hands, call the offices of The Kronzek Firm PLC today. Our phone lines are open 24/7 and our attorneys always have time to discuss your case with you.
