<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of things we always tell our clients, right at the very beginning, about how to deal with the police during a criminal investigation. Because people in these situations are usually frightened, stressed, and confused. And because they have been taught since childhood to obey people in uniform. So they often make mistakes which can jeopardize their own case, simply because they were trying to do the right thing. The results of this misjudgment can be devastating! </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to help you avoid that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is a list of different subjects that pertain to the police, and your dealings with them. Hopefully, reading this before you ever get arrested will help you make good choices during that very early stage in your case, which is often the most critical period.</span>

&nbsp;
<h1>COP SECRETS</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignorance of the law will not be a viable excuse when defending oneself against criminal charges, but ignorance of how the system works can get you into an even bigger heap of trouble. Especially where the police are concerned.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Years of defending the accused has taught us a number of very valuable things about law enforcement, and we would like to share those things with you. Because cops have lots of secrets, and knowing them will put you in a better position to defend yourself in the future. For more information, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h1>MIRANDA RIGHTS</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who's ever watched a cop show on TV has heard those famous words, "You have the right to remain silentâ€¦". But there is so much more to your constitutional Miranda rights that you may not know. Like when they apply and what they really mean, and how they affect you, and what happens when the arresting officer forgets to say them during a situation when the law says they should. Bottom line is that we recommend AGAINST waiving any of your rights until you have an attorney with you. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Miranda Rights are complex, and can have a huge impact on a case. For this reason, it is important that you are informed. So we've put together this page to answer some of your questions, and provide you with a little more information on the hugely important topic of your rights in a criminal investigation. For more information, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h1>POLICE LINEUPS</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police lineups are well known, both in real life and in the entertainment and media industries. A row of people, usually men, who stand under bright lights facing a one-way window. Behind it, a witness tries to identify someone they recognize from a crime they either witnessed, or were the victim of. However there is a lot more to lineups than most people realize. Many factors are at play here, and the smallest detail, the smallest wrong move, can make a big difference to the future of the case. For more information, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lineup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h1>POLICE MISTAKES</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The police are human, which means that they are not perfect, and they make mistakes. Many of these mistakes are simple errors, but they can affect the way a case is handled moving forward. Not Mirandizing a suspect, refusing you an attorney when you've asked for one, or forgetting to fill out the proper chain of custody documents for evidence. These are all examples of human error during investigations that can have life-changing results.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cases have been thrown out and overturned in court because of police mistakes. It happens every day. Which is why it is so critical that you know police mistakes do happen.

&nbsp;
<h1>POLICE SEARCHES</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords you the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. But what does this mean? What exactly constitutes "unreasonable"? How does the law define "search", and what do they mean by "seizure"? </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is important to know. Not knowing can result in you and your loved ones being taken advantage of by law enforcement officials who bend the law to suit their own purposes.

&nbsp;
<h1>DEFENSE AGAINST POLICE ABUSES AND MISCONDUCT</h1>
<img class="wp-image-25123 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/police-29859_1280-1024x909.png" alt="" width="198" height="175" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminal cases can move very quickly once they're rolling, so the sooner you have experienced legal representation on your side, the better protected you will be against police abuse of power and illegal activity. Remember, the police are required by law to follow certain procedures in order to do what they do. However, just because they should, doesn't mean they always do. Sometimes rules are overlooked, or simply ignored.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Kronzek Firm, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our highly skilled defense attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have decades of combined experience defending people from all over Michigan against those law enforcement officers who feel that they are above the law. Officers who believe that they can do whatever it takes, even illegal activities, to "get their man". Vigilantism and "cowboying" are not new concepts. So it's critical that your rights are properly defended.</span>
