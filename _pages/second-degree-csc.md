<h2>Second Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct Defense in Michigan</h2>
Second degree Criminal Sexual Conduct is a very serious Michigan sex crime. It involves allegations of criminal sexual contact, not criminal sexual penetration. There are various factors that could cause someone to be charged with second degree Criminal Sexual Conduct (CSC), rather than any of the other degrees.  However, the most common scenario is an allegation of a sexual touching of a child under the age of 13.

The attorneys at The Kronzek Firm have been defending CSC cases for approximately two decades, and have achieved many victories and <a title="Many trial victories" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent outcomes</a> for our clients.

<h2>Criminal Sexual Conduct 2nd Degree Charges | Valuable Guidance</h2>
You should always get your legal advice directly from the lawyer you have retained to assist you with your case.  However, here are some practical considerations that most successful CSC defense lawyers would agree with:
<ul>
 	<li>Don't talk about your case.  This means that you should not discuss your case with your friends, family, priest, pastor, police, cps worker or anyone else.  Especially in a case involving a child, all of these people can testify against you and some of the are mandatory reporters.</li>
 	<li>If you have already talked to police, stop talking.  We can often repair the damage, but continued mistakes don't help.</li>
 	<li>Don't defend yourself.  Really, that is our job.  Defendants often go around trying to do things that they think will help (like talking to police) only to find out it made matters worse.</li>
 	<li>Don't take a police polygraph.  The vast majority of people who take police polygraphs on CSC cases find that their situation gets worse, not better.  Talk to an attorney first.</li>
 	<li>Don't delay hiring an attorney.  Time is of the essence if you have been accused, charged or arrested for CSC or any other sex related crime.  If you know you are going to need an attorney, start looking now.</li>
 	<li>Don't hire a novice attorney.  Criminal sexual conduct case are not like drunk driving or shoplifting cases.  Make sure you are working with an attorney who know how to win a CSC trial.</li>
</ul>
