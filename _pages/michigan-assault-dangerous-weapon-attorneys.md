<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault with a dangerous weapon is a crime that explains itself: using a dangerous weapon to commit assault. Most often, Michigan prosecutors charge this as felonious assault. However, you do need to know what our Michigan law qualifies as “assault” or as a “dangerous weapon.” In this page of our web site, we define both in detail. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>What is considered an assault in Michigan? </b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, an assault can be: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committing a battery</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempting a battery</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting someone in a position where they reasonably fear a battery </span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26349 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/killer-820017_1280-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Battery is when the defendant (or some object used by the defendant) touches another person in a harmful or offensive way. The object could be a stick, a gun or any other inanimate object. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the quick definition of assault. For more detail, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visit our page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will give you more details about </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>What is a dangerous weapon in Michigan? </b></h1>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, a dangerous weapon is defined as any object that is used in a way that is likely to cause death or serious physical injury. This makes “dangerous weapon” is a fairly broad term, because there are literally thousands of household items that could be used to hurt someone. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What distinguishes a regular household item from a “dangerous weapon” is the intent you have when you use it. If you intend to use an item to commit an assault, then suddenly that item becomes a dangerous weapon. Of course, there are also items that are designed to be dangerous. A garden shovel can be a legal, household tool. If you decide to use the shovel to strike somebody, it suddenly becomes a dangerous weapon. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because dangerous weapons are determined in large part by the intent of the user, a case involving a dangerous weapon would need to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prove </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the intent of the defendant. The trial would need the jury to determine if the object was used in a dangerous way or was intended to be used in a dangerous manner. Hitting somebody with shovel could clearly be dangerous because it could cause harm. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-26350 alignleft" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hammer-1629587_640-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />In summary, there are limitless items that could be considered a dangerous weapon. A car, a pit bull, a beer bottle, a pistol, a machete, a hammer… The list of items is not what matters, but the intent of the accused certainly matters a great deal. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Felonious assault is a 4 year felony in Michigan. From there, it just gets worse. For example, a more serious felony is assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. Or assault with intent to murder. Or assault with intent to commit a sexual battery. </span>
