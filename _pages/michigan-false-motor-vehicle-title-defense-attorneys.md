<h3><b>The Crime of Passing Title or Transferring Possession of a Stolen Motor Vehicle</b></h3>
A person who knowingly makes a false statement either in an application for a certificate of title—or in an assignment of that title to another individual—may be charged with a felony. The context of this charge tends to be offering the statement in connection with passing title for a stolen motor vehicle.  Basically, anything you put in writing to the Michigan Secretary of State regarding your title or ownership of a vehicle is subject to scrutiny and possible criminal charges.

Furthermore, being charged with this does not exclude a person from being charged with receiving or concealing a stolen motor vehicle or other related crimes. In other words, other charges may arise in conjunction with this offense.
<h3>Penalty for False Motor Vehicle Title Charges</h3>
The maximum penalty is 10 years in prison, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both.  As with all felony charges in Michigan, an actual sentence will be affected by the Michigan Sentencing Guidelines.
<h3>The Elements of a False Title Charge</h3>
The prosecutor must prove all of the following beyond a reasonable doubt at trial for a conviction to occur. First, the defendant applied for a title of a motor vehicle. Second, the defendant made a false statement of a material fact; that is, an essential fact needed for a valid transfer to result. Third, the defendant knew that a false statement was being made at the time it was given.

There are many circumstances that the prosecutor could use to support a case against you, including if you requested a duplicate title or perhaps an expedited transfer of title as an indication of knowing the car was stolen.  However, the most common scenario remains that a person intentionally makes an untrue statement in order to conceal the fact that the car is stolen or has been totaled and re-built.
