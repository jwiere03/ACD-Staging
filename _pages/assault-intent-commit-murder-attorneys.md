<h3>What is Assault with Intent to Murder?</h3>
Assault with intent to commit murder is a specific intent crime. This means that the defendant is charged with intending to physically harm another and cause death. For a conviction to result at trial, the prosecutor must prove each part of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

&nbsp;

First, it must be shown that the defendant tried to physically hurt another person. Next, the prosecutor must show that when the defendant assaulted the other person, he or she had―or believed to have―the ability to cause the injury. Finally, it must be proven that the defendant intended to murder the assaulted person, without circumstances that legally excused or reduced the offense.

&nbsp;

This crime is a felony with a maximum  penalty of life in prison or any number of years.

&nbsp;
<h3>What is Assault with Intent to do Great Bodily Harm Less than Murder?</h3>
Great bodily harm (GBH) is a serious injury that can harm the function or health of a person's body.

&nbsp;

At trial, the prosecutor must prove all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. First, it must be proved that the defendant tried to physically harm another individual. Next, that the defendant either had (or believed to have) the ability to cause the harm. Third, the prosecution must show the defendant intended to cause the great bodily harm.

&nbsp;

For this crime, the victim does not actually need to be injured. However, if the victim is injured, the jury can consider if the defendant intended it. The maximum penalty for this felony is 10 years in prison, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both. Assaulting a person by suffocation or strangulation (smothering or choking) also carries the same punishment.
