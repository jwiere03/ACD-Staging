<h3>Lansing Assault Attorney</h3>
Assault cases are one of the most common types of prosecution in Lansing courts.  When handled by a skilled trial attorney, a substantial portion of assault cases should end with acquittals, dismissals and reduced charges.  At The Kronzek Firm, that has been the experience of our trial attorneys.  We have won many, many assault cases including criminal charges of assault and battery, assault with a deadly weapon and homicide.  If you are facing charges in any of the Court's in Lansing, East Lansing or Mason, Michigan, we can help.
<h3>Lansing Drug Crime Defense Lawyers</h3>
<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000008149063_Large.jpg"><img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-6728 alignright" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000008149063_Large-150x150.jpg" alt="Lansing Drug Crime Defense" width="150" height="150" /></a>The Kronzek Firm attorneys have been successfully defending drug crimes in Michigan for 20 years.  While we practice throughout Michigan, our main office has always been in Lansing.  We are very familiar with the judges and the courts in Mid-Michigan.  The effective defense of drug crimes often involves the suppression of evidence based on violation of your constitutional rights by police.

It is important to have an attorney who understands how to challenge the evidence that has been gathered against you.  Many people believe that drug enforcement officers trample on their rights when they make arrests, search vehicles and homes and make promises that they don't keep.  Many criminal defense attorneys are ineffective at challenging these abuses in court.

You should be working with a criminal defense attorney that is prepared to defend your rights in court.  Courts often seem like hostile territory to criminal defendants.  An effective and professional attorney will make the difference.  We offer free consultations to our clients so that they can examine for themselves the difference that personal attention and professionalism can make.
