<h3>Expert Michigan Manslaughter Defense</h3>
Any type of homicide charge is highly serious and requires equally serious criminal defense. If you are under investigation for manslaughter or have been criminally charged, we can help. The trial team at The Kronzek Firm has a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html">strong reputation</a> for providing the kind of aggressive legal representation that really gets results. You need experienced attorneys—and you need them right away!

&nbsp;
<h3>The Crime of Manslaughter in Michigan</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Voluntary Manslaughter</strong></li>
</ul>
Manslaughter can be either voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary manslaughter is the intentional killing of another human being in the heat of the moment with adequate provocation and without a significant lapse in time.

&nbsp;

In these cases, the defendant caused the death of another while intending to cause that death; great bodily harm to other person; or created a situation where the risk of great bodily injury or death was very high and such consequences would likely result. In addition, the defendant acted without lawful justification or excuse.

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Involuntary Manslaughter</strong></li>
</ul>
Involuntary manslaughter is the unintentional killing of another person while grossly negligently doing some act or intending to commit an injury. Regardless of which type you are facing, we can help you to understand the felony charges better and what factors are involved. Or, if you are facing <a title="Vehicular Manslaughter Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-vehicular-manslaughter-attorneys.html">vehicular manslaughte</a>r charges, we have extensive experience with that as well.

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Killing of an Unborn Child</strong></li>
</ul>
Furthermore, the willful killing of an unborn “quick” child is also deemed manslaughter. This includes injuring the mother by administering drugs to her or by harming her through other means. In other words, the injury results in the death of the fetus but not the mother. The term “quick” generally means the fetus is developed enough for the mother to sense movement. (MCL 750.322)

&nbsp;
<h3>The Penalty for Manslaughter in Michgian</h3>
The maximum penalty is the same for all forms of the offense; that is, up to 15 years in prison, or by fine up to $7,500.00, or both.

&nbsp;
<h3>Our Approach to Defending Manslaughter Charges</h3>
Prosecutors and police know how to overwhelm you during the investigation to get the information they need to convict you. Don’t play their game and gamble with your future. With any type of homicide charge, it is imperative to hire an attorney right away before you speak with law enforcement in order to protect your rights at every stage of your criminal case.

&nbsp;

However, here is the practical reality:  Most of our client's have spoken with the police before we meet them and we still help them.  If you have made statements already trying to be helpful, stop!  Let us worry about what has already happened.  At the same time, don't keep talking until you have consulted with us.  The first order of business is to make sure we aren't making mistakes from this time forward.

&nbsp;

Our attorneys work together in evaluating your case. We also meet with you regularly, answer your phone calls, and actively include you in all aspects of your defense.
