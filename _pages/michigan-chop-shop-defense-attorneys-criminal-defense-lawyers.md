<h2><b>Expert Michigan Chop Shop Defense</b></h2>
Are you in need of a Michigan chop shop defense attorney?  The trial lawyers at The Kronzek Firm have experience handling all aspects of automobile crime cases .

<h3><b>The Crime of Maintaining a Chop Shop</b></h3>
A chop shop is any building or storage area where people are engaged in dismantling, altering, reassembling, or concealing the identity of stolen cars, trucks, or any related major vehicle components. This can also be any place where 3 or more stolen vehicles or their components are present.

There is a wide range of car parts that the law defines as major components. Some include the engine, transmission, fenders, bumpers, tires, and much more.

A person who knowingly owns or runs a “chop shop” or helps another do so may be charged with a felony.
<h3>Penalties for Chop Shop Crimes</h3>
The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of up to <b>10 years</b>, a fine up to $250,000.00, or both. For second or subsequent convictions, the maximum prison sentence is the same; however, the fine is set at a minimum of $10,000.00 up to $250,000.00.

Furthermore, in addition to the penalties, a person convicted of this crime will be ordered to make restitution to the owner of the stolen car or car parts. If the person has already been compensated for the loss by an insurance company, then restitution will be ordered to be paid to the insurer instead.

Many items may be subject to seizure and possibly forfeiture by law enforcement related to this offense. This includes the stolen vehicles and parts, plus any money or other property allegedly linked to the chop shop as well. However, our lawyers have a tremendous amount of experience with this process and understand the ins and outs of getting property back to our clients in a timely fashion, whenever possible.
