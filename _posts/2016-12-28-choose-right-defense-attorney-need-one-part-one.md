<h2><b>Do you need an attorney in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you got a speeding ticket, or lost control of your car on an icy road and bumped into a street sign, but didn't stick around or report the accident, you could be cited by the police. While both of these count as breaking the law, some people think that you don’t need an attorney to represent you in court. However, if you have been </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged with a crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we mean </span><b>the kind of crime that will result in possible jail or prison time, then you are going to need an attorney. And quickly! </b>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>So, what kind of attorney do you need?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been accused of a crime, you need a criminal defense attorney. That doesn't mean you should just call up the first Michigan attorney that pops up when you do an online search. There are a number of things you need know in order to </span><b>narrow down your search to ensure that you get the right criminal defense attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for you.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Are the charges state or federal charges?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes a difference. </span><b>If the law you are accused of breaking was a state law, you will need an attorney who can legally practice law in the state of Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, if you have been accused of a federal crime you will need an attorney who can defend you in </span><a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Not all criminal lawyers in Michigan practice in federal court. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can seem very confusing, and we understand that. The thing to remember here is that </span><b>when you are charged with a federal crime, you are being prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s office</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as opposed to charges that are brought on a state level by the prosecuting attorney of a local county.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important point to remember is that </span><b>when facing federal charges you will be prosecuted by a U. S. Attorney who has far more time and resources at hand</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and therefore, the case may be more complex and more time consuming. So be sure to select </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a seasoned, well-respected attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with past experience and success in handling federal defenses. Practicing criminal defense in federal courts is very different than practicing in state courts. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Choose an attorney who can defend you properly</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All defense attorneys practicing in the state of Michigan can defend you against pretty much any state charge ranging, from drunk driving, sexual assault to drug crimes. But not all of them are going to give you the best possible defense. Why? Because </span><b>attorneys tend to focus their practices in certain areas, and choosing an attorney with no experience in handling the charges you are facing could mean a less-than-ideal defense</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Choosing the right attorney to protect you is often the critical difference in the best outcome to a case. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, at The Kronzek Firm, we have a number of attorneys on staff. While all of them are highly capable and very experienced, several of them specialize in particular areas of law, like </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sex crime defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPS defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bankruptcy, wills/trusts and even f</span><a href="http://www.midmichigandivorce.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amily law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For this reason, </span><b>we are able to meet every client’s needs by working together as a team, allowing those with more experience in certain areas to lead and guide a defense</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to ensure the best possible outcome.</span>
