<h2>Flint Man Facing Murder Charges</h2>
33-year-old Flint resident Carlon Hughey III, is now facing charges of first-degree murder, felon in possession of a firearm, carrying a concealed weapon and felony firearms, after having turned himself into police custody for the shooting that took place outside Brothers Party Store last week

According to the 68th District Court records, Hughey was arrested on September 30th and arraigned on October 3rd after he turned himself into to the Flint Police Department for the shooting of Calvin Walker.

Officers were dispatched to the scene of a shooting that took place directly in front of Brothers Party Store on North Saginaw Street at about 8:30 pm. The call was responded to by several departments, including the Flint police, the Michigan State Police and the Genesee County Sheriff's Department.

Calvin Walker was found lying on the ground in the parking lot outside the store, bleeding from a single gunshot wound. He was still alive when emergency medical personnel rushed him to Hurley Medical Center, but was pronounced dead by hospital officials shortly after arrival.

Although very few details about the shooting have been released to the public by the Flint Police Department who are currently still investigating the crime, Flint Police Chief James Tolbert confirms that Hughey did voluntarily turn himself over into police custody and that he has been arrested and charged.

All four charges that Hughey is facing are felonies under Michigan law. First-degree murder is punishable by imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole. Being a felon in possession of a firearm is punishable by up to five years in prison and a possible fine of $5,000.00, or both. Carrying a concealed weapon is punishable by up to five years in prison and a possible fine of $2,500.00, or both. A felony firearm charge, if this happens to be Hughey's first offense in this category, is punishable by up to 2 years in prison.
