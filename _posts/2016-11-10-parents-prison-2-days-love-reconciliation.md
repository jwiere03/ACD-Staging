<b>Incarcerated parents suffer as a result of being away from their children</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They miss out on the joy and satisfaction of being a mom or dad. They miss out on milestone moments, and on the small pleasures of everyday life with a child. Sure, parenting is hard and sometimes very frustrating, but it is also a very rewarding experience and parents in prison lose out on countless opportunities to be enriched. But </span><b>the people who suffer even more are the children</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/faq/incarcerated-parent-rights.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incarcerated parents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Children with parents in prison miss out on a whole host of things that can never be replaced. They either lose one parent, which means that they grow up without the love and guidance of a very important person in their lives, or they grow up raised by people other than their own parents. Either way, they miss out. </span><b>But there is one organization working to offer hope to those children and their parents who are separated by bars</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 5, 2016, at Michiganâ€™s </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,4551,7-119-68854_1381_1385-5333--,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cotton Correctional Facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Jackson, </span><b>a select group of incarcerated parents got to spend a full day with their children.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A day full of balloons, magic shows, shared meals and quiet time. A day in which memories are made, bonds are strengthened, and real relationships are allowed to flourish. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"One Day with God" a camp hosted by </span><a href="http://www.forgivenministry.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgiven Ministry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>aims to provide those parents and children, separated by prison </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><b>sentences</b></a><b>, a chance at reconciliation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. About 30 prisoners participated in this particular event, although events just like this take place with regularity all over Michigan and several other states.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The event, which lasts two days, provides imprisoned parents with guidance and allows them a chance to provide their rarely-seen children with the same. </span><b>The event offers children an opportunity to be one-on-one with their parents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a luxury rarely enjoyed, as monthly visits are often dominated by other family members with grievances to air and family issues to talk over.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Children and their parents enjoy puppet shows, a magic show, a daddy-daughter dance, and the chance to eat meals and do crafts together.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They get time to talk without the pressures of a rushed timeline and other visitors vying for a chance to talk. This is just them - parents and their kids, and a beautiful chance to forge a lasting relationship in the darkest of times.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>The impact goes beyond relationship - it affects the future</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may wonder why a non-profit organization and a host of volunteers would go to all of the trouble to let </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convicted criminals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan have a day of play with their children? After all, "you do the crime, you do the time", right? And why should prisoners get special perks when they are guilty of breaking the law? Well, hard as it may be for some to understand, </span><b>there is a very important reason behind this.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, there's the fact that prisoner's children had no say in what their parents did and they shouldn't have to suffer without moms and dads who love them. But that aside, it is well known that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convicts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struggle to readjust to normal life on the "outside" once their sentences are over. But those with strong family ties adjust much more easily. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>They have a reason to be strong and stay on the right path </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- their children and families. By allowing them opportunities to strengthen their relationships with their loved ones, we also provide them with incentives to straighten up their lives. A reason to become better citizens, and better parents. In a nutshell, it's a win-win for everyone.</span>
