Stephanie Terpening, the band director for St Ignace High School, is facing criminal charges for allegedly growing and selling marijuana, along with other drug related charges.

Not many details have been released about the events that led to Terpening's arrest. Media sources were told that police pulled a man over on several felony warrants, and the circumstances of his arrest led police to Terpening.<!--more-->

The Michigan State Police searched a home where Terpening was staying. "They determined that 3 suspects were involved, those 3 were ultimately arrested. They seized a number of marijuana plants and equipment used to manufacture along with cell phones and money," explained Detective Lieutenant Timothy Sholander, a member of the MSP's Upper Peninsula Substance Enforcement Team, or UPSET.


<h2>Terpening had legal medical marijuana card</h2>

According to the officers present at the search, Terpening does have a legal medical marijuana card. However, authorities are claiming that there is evidence of illegal distribution that led to the marijuana charges. "People are allowed to have a medical marijuana card but it doesn't give the person a right to sell or distribute to someone who isn't a patient."

Stephanie Terpening is charged with a single count of criminal enterprise/conspiracy, two counts of manufacturing marijuana, and a single count of drug delivery/manufacture. She is also charged with a single count of maintaining a drug house.

Terpening was arrested and arraigned, but has since posted the $50,000 bail. She is not currently being held in police custody and is scheduled to return to court for her preliminary hearing on October 21st.

Don Gustafson, the Saint Ignace Area Schools Superintendent, says that Terpening was employed by the school district for twelve years. She was put on leave as soon as the school was informed of her arrest.

"We acted immediately as soon as we found out. She was placed on leave until further notice all in interest of student safety. We will make sure the substitute is qualified and does a good job with their students."

Parents, however, were not quite as diplomatic in their responses. Emily Misner, a parent from the area expressed her frustration at the situation, saying, "I'm very angry someone like this is teaching our kids who is supposed to be a role model."
