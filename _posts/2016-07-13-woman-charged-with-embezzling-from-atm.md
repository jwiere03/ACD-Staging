<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey M. Arquette, a 26-year-old resident of Standish, MI, has been accused of embezzling several thousand dollars from an ATM in the store where she worked as the store manager. The store, Dore's Party Store, is located in Kawkawlin Township, says that this has been an ongoing problem for some time now.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Michigan State Police, who investigated the incident, a trooper was called to the store where the regional manager was present and made the accusations against Arquette. The trooper was told that Arquette had taken over the duty of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/retail-crime.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filling the ATM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January of this year, and since then there had been a number of instances where the ATM account was </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short of money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the regional manager, the total amount of money missing thus far is almost $3,000. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The regional manager fired Arquette in front of the trooper, right before the trooper began the interview. When asked about the missing money, Arquette initially claimed that she had no idea where it was and pointed out that she had been the one to bring it to the regional manager's attention. </span>

&nbsp;

<h2>Arquette’s responses changed as the interview progressed</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to the Michigan State Police trooper, Arquette's responses changed as the interview progressed. Eventually she told the trooper that she no longer wanted to deal with this situation and just wanted to pay back the money and be done with it. The initial interview was conducted on April 5th, and a warrant was issued for Arquette's arrest on June 27th. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquette appeared voluntarily for her arraignment on July 7 in the Bay County District Court and was released again on a personal recognisance bond. The judge scheduled her next appearance, which is the preliminary hearing, for Tuesday, July 19th.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Arquette has been charged with a single count of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between $1,000 and $20,000. Under Michigan law this is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000, or three times the amount stolen. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being convicted of embezzlement or any other variety of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-check-fraud-law.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial or fraud crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will have a major impact on your future. In addition to the difficulty one can have getting a decent job with a felony conviction on your record, being accused of stealing money will make you appear as an  untrustworthy thief. This makes getting a good job in the future difficult or impossible. </span>
