&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The way Michigan approaches the issue of veterans caught up in the legal system has </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/judge-concerned-about-veterans-ptsd-serves-time-with-him.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changed dramatically in recent years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - a fact that has seen countless former soldiers and war heros offered a new lease on life. It's something we've written about before, as </span><b>the way our legal system handles traumatized soldiers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shifts towards something far more compassionate. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Michigan has a total of 25 Veteran's Courts scattered throughout our Great Lakes State, the recent news article has highlighted the operations of the one in Monroe, MI and shined a light on it's success. According to an article in The Monroe News, the </span><a href="http://www.co.monroe.mi.us/courts_of_monroe/1st_district_court/veterans_treatment_court.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monroe County Veteran's Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has seen unprecedented success in their treatment of military veterans who are caught up in the legal system.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First Monroe County District Court Judge Terrence P. Bronson, who started the Veteran's Court in Monroe County, is a veteran himself. A retired Navy captain, Judge Bronson saw the need for a different way to help vets </span><b>struggling with PTSD and the transition back into civilian life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The whole purpose, he says, is to help veterans, and it's a point he makes very clear to every former soldier that darkens the door of his court.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Bronson's court is made up of seven professionals from a variety of different </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and veteran agencies. One of them is Monroe County Assistant Prosecutor Ronald J. Benore Jr. who is an eight year Army veteran. Working together, </span><b>the team helps each vet to get back on their feet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through therapy, medication, treatment, assistance and oversight.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his interview with The Monroe News, Assistant Prosecutor Ronald J. Benore says that he's seen veterans who were suicidal and at the end of their rope bounce back and </span><b>go on to lead productive and fulfilling lives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lives that include lasting relationships, rewarding careers and even opportunities to give back to the community.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Judge Bronson, a total of </span><b>14 vets have graduated successfully</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from his program, with another seven currently enrolled. Only five have not completed the program so far, and of those, only two </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ended up behind bars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It's not perfect, but it's a world better than all of those people in jail, struggling with addiction and with no hope for the future. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a lot of work, the judge admits, but it's worth every second. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Michigan legal system, the veteran courts are referred to as the '</span><a href="http://courts.mi.gov/administration/admin/op/problem-solving-courts/pages/veterans-treatment-court.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Solving Courts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.' They are part of a greater system of courts aimed at helping people deal with the deeper issues that result in </span><b>otherwise decent human beings ending up in cuffs in front of a judge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These courts include the Sobriety Courts, the Mental Health Courts, and the Veteran Courts. Another important benefit of these problem solving courts is they divert people away from prisons and jails. Are you shocked to learn that 19% of Michigan’s total state budget goes to the Michigan prison system. Yes, we were pretty shocked too. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Veterans Court emphasizes stability and recovery for military veterans who have been arrested for crimes that stem from their struggle with recovery from their service to our country. </span><b>Non-violent offenders who qualify for the program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are closely supervised and required to participate in intensive therapy sessions, as well as get their medications in order and stay clean. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In return for lighter sentences, or even deferred sentences, Veteran Courts help veterans to </span><b>receive what they need to get back on their feet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This includes group and independent therapy, substance abuse counseling, stable employment, housing, and partnering with mentors</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are deeply grateful to the men and women who fought for our nation's freedom, and </span><b>we look forward to the day when they are afforded all of the necessary respect, assistance, and care that they deserve</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are a veteran who has been arrested for a crime in Michigan, call and talk to an </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at The Kronzek Firm immediately at 866-766-5245. Whether it's weapons-related, drug-related, drunk driving, or a sex crime, we are here to help you get back on your feet. </span>
