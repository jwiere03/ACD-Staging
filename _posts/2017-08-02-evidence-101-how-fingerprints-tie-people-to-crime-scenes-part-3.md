&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thanks to us here at The Kronzek Firm, for our breakdown on how law enforcement </span><b>collects and analyzes fingerprints found at crime scenes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/evidence-101-how-fingerprints-tie-people-to-crime-scenes-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously in this series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we've talked about where fingerprints are found, the different types, and how they are collected. In this last installment, we're going to look at who does the analysis and where it happens.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How are fingerprints analyzed?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once fingerprints have been collected from the crime scene and properly documented, they are sent off to the crime lab for further analysis. Analysis of the prints </span><b>used to be done manually</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by a person who compared images of fingerprints and tried to make a visual match. This was a slow, tedious process with a very large </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">margin of error</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thankfully, the use of computers changed all that.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in the process is a visual check of the print to determine </span><b>if it is of sufficient quality to make a comparison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If not, it is labelled as unsuitable and the analysis ends. If it is determined to be good enough for a comparison, then the analysis continues.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the print is deemed usable, the analyst will do a </span><b>side by side comparison with the print of a suspect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if one is available. If there is no suspect, the analyst simply moves to the next step.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is the automated system. Most law enforcement agencies have access to AFIS - the </span><b>Automated Fingerprint Identification System</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . IAFIS, the FBI's integrated fingerprint identification is the largest fingerprint database in the world. It currently holds more than 72 million </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">print records collected from criminals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, military personnel, government employees, immigrants and other civilian employees.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After checking the automated system, the </span><b>analyst evaluates the results</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and comes up with a determination about the print. Was it a match, or are the results inconclusive?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step is verification, where </span><b>the print match is independently checked</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and verified by a different analyst, to ensure that the match is correct.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Who performs the fingerprint analysis?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysis of fingerprints is usually performed by a forensic scientists, crime lab technicians, or specially trained police officers. Most law enforcement agencies require that the analyst doing fingerprint comparisons have </span><b>at least a four year degree in science</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which could include biology, chemistry or physics. Many agencies also require that their analysts are certified by the International Association for Identification (IAI).</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Fingerprints at crime scenes:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The average crime scene yields countless fingerprints, many of which are useless to police. Think about your home. Think about how many people have come into your house in the last month. </span><b>Even a relatively conscientious cleaner doesn't make a habit of washing walls</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with regularity, or scrubbing cabinet fronts. So even if you keep a clean home, chances are there are hundreds of fingerprints throughout your house, left by people who were </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there for entirely legitimate reasons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why it can sometimes be very difficult for police to use fingerprints in narrowing down a group of suspects. Especially if </span><b>all of the suspects had legitimate reasons</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for being at the crime scene before the crime took place. This also applies when the crime took place in a busy public setting, where there is no way to eliminate innocent people's fingerprints.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As defense attorneys, we understand that there is a lot more to solving a crime than simply matching fingerprints. Just because a person's prints were found at a crime scene, doesn't mean that they are a criminal, or </span><b>that they were even present when the crime happened</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So if you or a loved one have been accused of a crime because police have linked evidence found at a crime scene to you, then you are going to need a highly skilled defense attorney. Call 866 766 5245 immediately, and let our </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced criminal defense attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> protect your rights and your future.</span>
