<span style="font-weight: 400;">The name Ford is synonymous with American history in the form of the classic motor car. It was Henry Ford who gave the US its automobile history, and Michigan it's title as the "motor state." So it is little wonder that anyone born under the auspicious title of "Ford" will have their actions scrutinized by the media at the least provocation.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This has certainly been the case for Edsel Ford, great-grandson of Henry Ford. He was arrested a few days ago for an alleged </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domestic violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> incident that police said took place in his home in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Edsel Ford appeared in court for his arraignment, the prosecutor's office announced that they had declined to bring charges against him. The incident was described as a "very minor" physical </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Daniel Jensen, the director of public safety in Grosse Pointe Farms. As a result, he explained, Â there is not enough evidence to justify charges.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, domestic assault, also known as domestic violence, is a misdemeanor charge, punishable by up to 93 days in jail, a $500 fine, or both for the first offense. A second offense is also a misdemeanor, but the punishment is increased to a possible 1 year in jail, up to a $1,000 fine, or both. A third offense is a felony, and is punishable by up to 2 years in prison, a fine of up to $2,500, or both.</span>

<h2>Wife Makes Statement in Support of Her Husband's Innocence</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynthia Ford, formerly Cynthia Layne Neskow, made a public statement in support of her husband's innocence. "Contrary to reports, this is not a case of domestic violence." She explained in a statement to the media, "I stand behind true victims of domestic violence and I am not one of them." She went on to say that she and Ford are "working in the right direction to heal from this experience and move forward." Together the couple have four sons.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As defense attorneys who are also spouses and parents, we are encouraged to see a couple working through their marital difficulties without false allegations or the unnecessary involvement of the authorities. People make mistakes, and it is gratifying to see this couple pull together in the wake of this unfortunate incident and stand by one another. We wish them the best on their journey toward healing. Our criminal defense team says that this outcome is pretty common with domestic violence allegations. The alleged victim and the alleged batterer work it out between themselves and decide how they can keep the case out of court. </span>
