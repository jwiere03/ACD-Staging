<h2><b>Accepts Plea Bargain One Day Before Trial</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle A. Schmiege, a 24-year-old resident of Bay City with an extensive criminal history in the area, has chosen to accept a plea bargain just one day before his trial was scheduled to begin. He pled guilty to home invasion charges as part of a plea bargain that will significantly reduce his charges. But that doesn't change the fact that he will still end up behind bars for quite a few years.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schmiege appeared recently in the Bay County Circuit Court before Chief Judge Kenneth W. Schmidt in order to enter his plea. Having accepted the prosecution's offer, he pled guilty to two counts of Â second-degree <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">home invasion</a>. Under Michigan law, these are felonies punishable by up to 15 years in prison.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But in exchange for his plea bargain, the prosecution has agreed to dismiss 14 other charges, stemming from four unrelated incidents, that Schmiege was also facing. Among the dismissed charges were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first-degree home invasion, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felony firearm</a>, larceny in a building, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes.html" target="_blank">breaking and entering</a> with intent to commit a larceny, larceny of a firearm, receiving and concealing stolen property less than $200, illegal possession of a firearm, and also illegal possession of ammunition.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Bay County Assistant Prosecutor Jeff Stroud has agreed that Schmiege's minimum sentence shouldn't exceed eight years. But because Schmiege was a parolee at the time of the most recent criminal acts, he will now be required to serve out the remainder of his previous sentence as well as any new sentencing time assigned to him by the Judge. He is also eligible for consecutive sentences as a result.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, Schmiege's most recent charges stem from two incidences that took place on December 17th, and then on February 23rd. He apparently first broke into a house on Chilson street, where he stole a television. Then, he broke into a home on Warner street, where surveillance cameras show him taking a gun, ammunition, two televisions, video games, shoes, and a heater.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schmiege is scheduled to be sentenced on October 26th at 1:30 pm by Judge </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schmidt.</span>
