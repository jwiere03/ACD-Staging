<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, federal law enforcement launched an investigation into a drug trafficking ring in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As the investigation unfolded, it came to light that the group was larger and more complex than they previously thought. </span><b>One arm of the trafficking circle allegedly brought </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank"><b>cocaine</b></a><b> all the way to Detroit from the U.S. Virgin Islands</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The other branch dealt heroin in Pennsylvania, Detroit, and several places in between.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, local and federal law enforcement teams around the U.S. began dismantling the interconnected </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rings on September 1, 2016. Under the supervision of the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force, </span><b>police and FBI agents from Detroit, Pittsburgh, the Virgin Islands, Cleveland, New York and Atlanta were all involved</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h2>Fourteen Indictments and Twelve Arrests</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, there were </span><b>fourteen individuals named in the federal indictment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Only twelve of those indicted have been arrested so far, but police are still looking for the other two. Of those fourteen people, </span><b>three are from the Detroit area</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 33-year-old Vanier Murraine of Ferndale, MI, 36-year-old Victor Burnett Jr. of Oak Park which is in Oakland County, and 27-year-old Frank Williams of Detroit were all arrested. Others hailed from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and from Cleveland and Twinsburg in Ohio.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton, "This investigation, which utilized </span><b>Title III wiretap intercepts, controlled drug purchases and other investigative techniques</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, established the existence of several overlapping and interrelated drug distribution networks with tentacles in the </span><b>Western District of Pennsylvania, Northern District of Ohio, Eastern District of Michigan, Northern District of Georgia and the District of the Virgin Islands</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-count indictment alleges that sometime in January of 2016, up until September, 2016,  a number of people were involved in the distribution of heroin. As a result, several of the arrested 12, </span><b>including the three people from Detroit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have been charged with Conspiracy to Distribute Heroin, and Possession with Intent to Distribute one Kilogram or More of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both of these charges are </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felonies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Murraine, Burnett, and Williams were all arrested on Thursday morning in Michigan. Their <strong>initial appearances were made that same day in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan</strong>. As of now, no information is available on when their next court appearances will be, and whether or not they have hired attorneys yet.</span>
