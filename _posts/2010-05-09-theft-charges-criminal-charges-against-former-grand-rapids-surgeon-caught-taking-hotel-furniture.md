When travelers stay in hotels all over the world, it is not uncommon to keep some items provided by the hotel--small shampoos and conditions, sewing kits, or instant coffee are generally considered complimentary and are welcome to repossession by guests. However, any experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyer would recommend tourists against taking larger items, such as furniture, as that is considered theft and is against the law. Although an unusual form of robbery, an recent example is seen in the case of a former Grand Rapids surgeon has been charged with theft after being caught taking furniture and wall art from a hotel he was vacationing at.

Former surgeon Roger Gemmen, 75, has spent his retirement transferring between two houses, one located on Lake Michigan, and the other in the southern United States. Since 2001, he allegedly stole items from a hotel and used the furniture to furnish his two homes, thus prompting the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes.html" target="_blank">theft charges</a> against him.

Although the owner of the inn noticed missing items over the years, he was unable to discover how the items were being taken from the building. However, in February 2010, a hotel employee noticed that a pair of missing upholstered chairs were taken from the building and loaded into a truck with a Michigan license plate. During Gemmen's next visit, the same employee wrote down his license plate number and handed it over to hotel officials and police officers.

<h2>Gemmen confessed when confronted on stolen items</h2>

After obtaining a search warrant, law enforcement officials went through Gemmen's southern home. Immediately, the hotel owner was able to identify seven items that had been taken from his business. Once police contacted Gemmen and confronted him about the stolen items, he confessed. According to police spokesman Michael Herman, "Gemmen specifically told investigators that it was not a crime of greed and an expression of anger toward an individual." Despite this, detectives have been unable to pinpoint a connection between Gemmen and the hotel or hotel owners that would prompt the retaliation.

Gemmen was arrested by police officers last Tuesday and is charged with seven counts of grand theft, on a $17,500 bond. For the theft charges, he could face a maximum of five years in prison.

As seen by the example of Roger Gemmen, taking unauthorized items from any business, even a hotel, is illegal and can bring significant consequences against a person. Conviction of any criminal charges, including robbery or theft, will almost certainly infringe on beloved personal liberties and freedoms, often resulting in jail time.
