&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">House Representative Stephanie Chang has introduced a new bill into the Michigan Legislature that would require the state to do a better job of tracking </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">officer involved shootings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><b>Use of Force by Law Enforcement Reporting Act</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bill that Rep. Chang has been pushing for for several years. However now, in the midst of the social media storm about NFL players and others "taking a knee" in protest of police shootings of innocent and unarmed civilians, she says it is needed more than ever.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Chang described in her opinion piece, published in the Detroit Free Press, "</span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2017-2018/billintroduced/House/pdf/2017-HIB-4827.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 4827</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require police departments to submit an annual report to the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES) with </span><b>the number and type of certain use-of-force complaints</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made against officers of that department, the number of officer-involved shootings in that department, the results of any investigations of those incidents, and the racial, ethnic and gender demographics of those involved."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this, Chang explains, is the need for transparency in our law enforcement agencies. Increased </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transparency and accountability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will translate, Chang insists, into </span><b>a stronger relationship between officers and civilians</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is something we could all use a little more of right now. Current relationships between law enforcement agencies, here in Michigan and all over the US, are strained at best. The reason being the highly publicized cases in which officers overstepped the boundaries of their badges and in some cases, abused their authority.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Is use of force really necessary in today's police practices?</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the National Institute of Justice explains, "The use of force by law enforcement officers becomes necessary and is permitted under specific circumstances, such as in self-defense or in defense of another individual or group." However, while </span><b>there are many situations where the use of force makes sense</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and is completely justified, there are a frightening number of instances where it isn't. Instances that seem to be on the rise, both her in Michigan and across the nation. Instances where </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rights are violated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in some cases, lives are lost.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"There is increasing attention across the country on race and our criminal justice system." Chang states in her opinion piece. "Having more </span><b>easily accessible public information about shooting incidents and the use of force</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would help community members, law enforcement stakeholders and policymakers better understand any </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police conduct issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that need to be addressed locally and across the state and help us tackle these problems." She goes on to explain that "Community relations can only improve safety for both the officers on the streets, and the residents they are sworn to protect."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at The Kronzek Firm we have encountered both sides of the coin. Hard working and honest police officers who want nothing more than to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lineup.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep their communities safe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>corrupt cops who are in it for the power and profit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unfortunately, the bad cops, who are by far the smaller percentage of officers, tend to get a lot of press, which makes the remaining good officers look bad as well.</span>
