Crimes occur all over the world. So much so, that most people do not think twice when criminal reports are broadcasted on the nightly news. However, every once in a while there is a case that seems to interest the entire country—a case that has an outcome that shocks many, gives a skilled <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com">criminal defense attorney</a> recognition for doing what seems impossible, and leaves lawmakers questioning if more laws should be passed or if existing ones should be more strictly enforced. The July 5, 2011 verdict in the Casey Anthony trial is one of those cases.

<h2>Many are applauding Senator Jones’ efforts</h2>

In response to the Anthony verdict, Michigan lawmakers are trying to make it a felony for failing to report that a child is missing if more than 24 hours pass from the time that the child disappears. Michigan Senator Rick Jones is currently drafting this bill, which if passed, will be called Caylee’s Law. There are many who are applauding Senator Jones’ efforts. Yet, he is not the only one who is trying to combat crimes of this nature through legislation. Tonya Schuitmaker, another Michigan lawmaker, is trying to get a law passed that will require those who find a dead body to swiftly report the news to the police. There is a possibility that either one or both of the bills might become the law in Michigan.

There are advantages and disadvantages in having both bills made into laws. Supporters of Caylee’s Law believe that if put into effect, there will be less missing children, as parents will have to be more aware of the whereabouts of their children. Also, supporters believe that missing children in Michigan may be found quicker and before any harm occurs to them. Similarly, the requirement to report a dead body may also allow criminals to be caught and cases to be solved at a faster rate. As a result, Michigan’s top criminal lawyers may experience an increased case load as the number of reported <a title="Michigan Homicide Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html">homicides</a> may go up, and those criminals will need representation.

According to opponents, top defense attorneys could have their hands full and police departments may be overrun with reports resulting from the passage of such laws. Some who oppose Caylee’s Law believe that this new law may be passed merely out of anger and as an emotional reaction to the Anthony case. It has also been argued that parents may become overly cautious and report a child missing who may not be missing at all. Similarly, requiring the reporting of a discovered dead body could result in people mistakenly reporting something as a dead body that might not even be a body. As a result, police department phonelines could become flooded with frivolous calls, which could prevent officers from being able to handle more serious matters.

However, no matter if one is for or against the passage of either bill, there is a possibility that Michigan may soon have new laws added to the long list of already-existing laws. As a result, people accused of homicide will need to seek out the best Michigan criminal defense attorneys to represent them.

Ultimately, the Anthony case has gotten the country’s attention and has Michigan lawmakers hard at work trying to pass new laws. The Anthony case has also shown that a skilled attorney working on a homicide defense can produce a favorable and seemingly impossible verdict of not guilty for a defendant who was already assumed guilty in the eyes of many. The criminal defense team at The Kronzek Firm salutes Attorney Baez for fighting against all the odds to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America and its strong presumption of innocence that helps all of us. God Bless America.
