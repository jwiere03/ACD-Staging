A moment of rage can easily lead to the need for a top flight criminal defense attorney. A recent Ingham County case illustrates this.
<h2>Michigan Teenager Charged With Murder</h2>
A teenager from Rochester Hills was charged with the murder of an MSU student late last month, reportedly stabbing the victim to death. Connor McCowan, 19, is accused of killing Michigan State senior Andrew Singler on February 23rd. Police say that McCowan stabbed Singler multiple times, including in the heart, during an argument that took place at Singler’s Meridian Township apartment. McCowan may be facing a sentence of life in prison if convicted of the charge.

According to police and prosecutors McCowan, who does not have a prior criminal record, began the argument that led to the murder via numerous text messages. The argument apparently stemmed from a previous one between Singler and McCowan’s sister. News outlets report that at the time of the murder Singler was dating McCowan’s sister. Eventually, very early on the morning of the 23rd, McCowan reportedly went to Singler’s apartment and confronted him. Police say that Singler’s roommate witnessed both the argument and the murder, which was said to have taken place on the doorstep of the house. The roommate then drove Singler to Sparrow Hospital where the victim died of his wounds.

After the murder McCowan reportedly drove home and told his father he had killed Singler. According to police the arrest was made there. McCowan is currently in Ingham County jail, where prosecutors have asked that he be held without bond.
