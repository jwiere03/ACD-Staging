<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are just joining us, we recommend that you take a look at this four part series on false confessions from </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-confessions-lie-isnt-actually-lie-part-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the beginning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give you a clearer picture of our position. However, if you've been with us from the start, then </span><b>you will know about the Reid technique and the fact that it is entirely possible to convince someone that they are guilty of a crime they never committed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this final segment we are going to look at what the law here in Michigan says about false confessions, and how that may affect you.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2012, the </span><a href="http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruled that </span><b>experts on false confessions can sometimes testify to jurors in criminal cases if their testimony is otherwise deemed reliable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The case that was directly impacted by this ruling, in which Livingston County resident Jerome Walter Kowalski was accused of murdering his brother and sister-in-law, did not truly benefit from it. This was because the Michigan Supreme Court also supported the Michigan Court of Appeals decision to exclude the testimony of a psychologist who was deemed unreliable. However, it did set a precedent for other cases in the future. The admissibility of expert testimony is tightly controlled by our Michigan Court Rules. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is great, because false confessions are a very real issue that more judges and prosecutors would do well to pay attention to. Unfortunately, </span><b>as a society we struggle with the idea that an innocent person would falsely confess to a crime without being tortured, intoxicated, or mentally unsound</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to </span><a href="http://www.falseconfessions.org/experts/48-richard-leo" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Leo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a law professor at the University of San Francisco and an acclaimed expert in false confessions, most people simply cannot accept the fact that an innocent person would ever confess to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a serious crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they didn't commit.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This denial translates directly to the belief that "if you admitted it, you must have done it." End of story. That simply isn't truel. A recent study conducted at </span><a href="https://msu.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan State University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly M. Fenn, associate professor of psychology,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals that </span><b>even something as common as sleep deprivation will impact whether or not someone is likely to confess falsely to a crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is the first direct evidence that sleep deprivation increases the likelihood that a person will falsely confess to wrongdoing that never occurred." Fenn explained. "It’s a crucial first step toward understanding the role of sleep deprivation in false confessions and, in turn, </span><b>raises complex questions about the use of sleep deprivation in the interrogation of innocent and guilty suspects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings us back to the Reid Technique. While a suspect always has the choice of denying the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accusations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against them, many believe that this method of interrogation is still very risky. The reason being, it is subject to conformation bias. This means that </span><b>the Reid technique could reinforce inaccurate assumptions or beliefs and result in alternative leads not being followed during the investigation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, there is the risk that vulnerable people will be at a much higher risk of making false confessions. Vulnerable people like those who may not have had enough sleep the night before. Other people that are vulnerable include younger people, low functioning people, traumatized people and people that have been in police custody for many hours. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you look at this information, and take into account the incredible results of Dr. Julia Shaw and Dr. Stephen Porter's study which we discussed in the first article, </span><b>it's easy to understand why people in Michigan are so concerned about false confessions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It's a startling and very important discovery to know exactly how easy it is to get someone to believe something untrue. Something which could land them in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prison for life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, convicted of a crime they didn't commit. </span>
