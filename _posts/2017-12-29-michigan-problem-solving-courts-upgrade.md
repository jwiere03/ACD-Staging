&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan's problem-solving courts are a subject we've discussed with our readers on several occasions before. After all, they're making a huge impact on </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/links.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan's justice system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we happen to </span><b>have more of them than any other state in the US</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (because we're awesome!) But on that good note, we have some even better news for you - our problem-solving courts are about to undergo an upgrade, making them even more efficient than before!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Snyder recently signed Senate Bills 435, 437, and 438 into law. The bills, sponsored by state Senator Tonya Schuitmaker, </span><b>address a few much-needed changes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among Michigan's problem-solving courts. (For those of you who aren't sure what we mean when we say "problem solving courts, we're referring to Michigan's drug, sobriety, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigans-mental-health-courts-new-face-justice-2.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/veterans-court-monroe-county-new-hope-struggling-warriors.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veterans' treatment courts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>So what have the new laws done to help the courts better serve the people of Michigan? </strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, for starters, the bills align the many different problem-solving courts’ definition of “</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violent offender</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">." This means legal definitions are the same across all of the different courts. That’s important, because </span><b>only non-violent offenders are allowed to participate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan’s problem-solving court programs. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important issue that was addressed by the bills was the issue of jurisdictional transfer. One of the problems that can reduce the efficiency of problem solving courts is not being able to </span><b>transfer defendants from one court to another</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based on the services they need most. By streamlining the process, people can now be moved from one problem-solving court to another, having </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their needs met quickly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more efficiently. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you unfamiliar with MIchigan's problem-solving courts, here's a quick overview: These court are different from ordinary courts, in that they aim to solve the underlying issues that led to the criminal act, not just incarcerate offenders. In other words, </span><b>they're proactive courts, not reactive courts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their role is to help address problems, like alcoholism, mental health issues, and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that led to arrest so as to prevent recurring offenses.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>What do the problem-solving courts do in Michigan?</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, there are Michigan’s Mental Health Courts. They focus less on determining guilt and innocence, and more on helping those caught up in the criminal justice system who're also</span><b> struggling with mental health issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They do this by providing access to whatever is needed - counseling, group therapy, assistance finding jobs and housing, mentors, help with medications,the list is long. But the benefits are enormous!</span>
