<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Appling, the 24-year-old former Michigan State University basketball star is having a very rough year. </span><b>He has now been arrested a total of three times since May of this year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/former-msu-star-arrested-again-on-weapons-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all three times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weapons related charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to police records, an officer observed a 2013 blue Dodge Charger committing a traffic offense on Sunday night in Detroit and pulled the vehicle over. As he approached the car, the police officer said that he could smell a very strong odor of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He asked the driver for his license and registration. </span><b>But as the documents were passed towards him, the driver allegedly rolled up the window and drove away</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chased the vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and finally stopped it on Detroit's east side. </span><b>The driver, who was none other than the much maligned Spartan basketball player Keith Appling, was arrested</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This third set of charges is alleged to have occurred while Appling was out on bond for his first two sets of charges. When the car was searched the officer who had initially pulled Appling over said that he had noted a Gucci bag on the passenger seat of the car. That bag was now missing.</span>

&nbsp;


<h2>Officers find Beretta gun alongside road</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers retraced their steps, searching the entire length of the chase, and found the bag on the side of the road. Inside the bag officers found paperwork that contained Appling's name, along with a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The gun is listed as </span><b>a semi-automatic Beretta, and it was loaded with ten rounds of ammunition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Appling's third arrest in less than six months. In May he was arrested outside the Pantheon Club, which is a strip club in Dearborn, MI. Club </span><b>security personnel allegedly saw Appling pull an AK-47 from the trunk of his vehicle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A police search of the vehicle revealed a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">handgun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the front seat, a loaded weapon in the trunk, and a small amount of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Appling was arrested and charged with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying a Concealed Weapon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a five-year felony; Possession of a Loaded Firearm in a Vehicle, which is a two-year high court misdemeanor; and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possession of Marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>But the very next month Appling was arrested again, this time for similar reasons</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second arrest took place in June. Appling was a passenger in his brother's car when an officer pulled them over for speeding and </span><b>observed Appling trying to hide a .40-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson under a car seat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He was again arrested and charged with carrying a Concealed Weapon in a Motor Vehicle. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This second offense is alleged to have occurred while Appling was out on bond for his first set of charges. Our criminal defense attorneys say that under Michigan law, an offense that is committed while a defendant is out on bond can cause the judge to use consecutive sentencing rather than concurrent sentencing in a case. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Appling was scheduled to appear in court this week for the two prior sets of charges. The most </span><b>recent developments are unlikely to help his case, however</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and may result in the Judge denying him </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bail-bonds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, given his history of repeat offenses. For now, Appling is facing many years in prison with the Michigan Department of Corrections. We will keep watching this story as it develops, and keep you updated.</span>
