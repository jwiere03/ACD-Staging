Corrupt cops. Just the words incite disgust and anger in civilians and officers alike. But what is almost worse, is the phenomenal amount of damage it does to the tenuous relationship that exists between police officers and the communities they serve. Which is certainly the case for the Detroit Police Department, who are reeling from the recent announcement regarding two Detroit police officers who were indicted for stealing and selling drugs.<!--more-->

According to the United States Attorney's Office, 34-year-old Lieutenant David Hansberry and 46-year-old Officer Bryan Watson (nicknamed Hater and Bullet) have been indicted on a number of very serious charges. Details in the indictment reveal that the charges for these two Detroit police officers stem from allegedly stealing money and drugs.

According to a spokesman for the US Attorney's office, the two Detroit police officers would conduct traffic stops and then perform "fake arrests" of the suspects while in uniform. In addition, they conducted property searches that were unauthorized, all for the purpose of stealing drugs and money from their victims.

They also allegedly set up false drug transactions, and then proceeded to rob their victims of money, personal property, and drugs. Â "In order to coerce their victims to flee," the indictment says, they identified themselves as police officers. All drugs and money left behind by the victims were then stolen.

And what did the two Detroit police officers do with all of these drugs that they supposedly stole? According to the indictment, they sold it. All money and personal property items were divided between the two, while drugs were sold and the profits were split.

In a recent statement by Detroit Police Chief James Craig, he expressed his sorrow at the fact that the two indicted officers had violated their oaths. Most officers, he said, are hard working and honest, but these two broke the trust.

"We are committed to the highest standards of integrity, and we will remove any officers who do not live up to those high standards." he explained, "Officers who violate the law cannot be tolerated because effective law enforcement requires public trust,"

Both officers were charged with single counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics, and conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery and two counts each of drug trafficking and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. In addition, they were also charged with multiple counts of interference with commerce by robbery and extortion, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine (five or more kilograms)

These charges are all federal felonies, and if convicted, these two officers are likely to spend the rest of their adult lives behind bars.
