<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thanks for joining us here at The Kronzek Firm for our series on fraud in Michigan. Because </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/financial-fraud-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fraud crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are so varied, and there's no way to sum them all up in one blog article. Therefore, we have decided to break it all down into a series that we hope will </span><b>answer some of your questions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and explain a few important details.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're only joining us now, you may want to take a moment to go back and </span><b>check out the previous articles in this series</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, starting with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-credit-card-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit card fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and covering many topics all the way through </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-insurance-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For those of you who've been with us from the beginning, let's hit the road.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is health care fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Health care fraud is when an individual or a company </span><b>defrauds an insurer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or government health care program, like Medicare. Health care fraud can include health insurance fraud, drug fraud, and medical fraud. It can be a state crime, a federal crime or both. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are examples of health care fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Health care fraud is usually perpetrated by doctors and physicians. It could include any of the following situations:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a doctor:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills a health insurance provider for appointments a patient failed to keep </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makes a false claim in order to receive financial compensation for services and/or supplies they didn't provide to patients</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowingly bills for more complex services than what was actually provided to the patient</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pays for referrals of Federal health care program beneficiaries</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What laws govern health care fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the FBI, health care fraud costs the country billions of dollars every year, which is why so much time, energy and resources are dedicated to finding and eradicating it. The FBI also warns that </span><b>sometimes civilians are the victims</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/health-care-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">health care insurance fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as their private information is accessed and used or sold.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of how extensive and costly health care fraud is, the federal government has numerous laws in place making </span><b>all types of health care fraud illegal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/civil/legacy/2011/04/22/C-FRAUDS_FCA_Primer.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">False Claims Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FCA) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-927-anti-kickback-act-1986"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-Kickback Statute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (AKS) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Fraud-and-Abuse/PhysicianSelfReferral/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physician Self-Referral Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Stark Law) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security Act </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Criminal Code</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Michigan also has laws governing the conduct of medical professionals in order to ensure that the health care system isn't abused. This includes the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-healthcare-claims.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Health Care False Claims Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which makes it illegal for any Michigan physician to make false claims, make medically unnecessary claims, accept kickbacks, conceal information or make false statements. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is the penalty for health care fraud in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Health care fraud is taken very seriously, both by the state of Michigan prosecutors and by the federal government. People found </span><b>guilty of health care fraud in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are facing the possibility of up to four years in prison, a fine up to $50,000.00, or both under state law.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under federal law the penalties are even more severe, and can range, depending upon which law a person is accused of breaking. Under federal law, the maximum penalty is 10 years in prison and a fine up to $250,000. If the crime results in </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bodily injury to a victim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the maximum penalty is 20 years in prison. </span><b>In cases of death, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or any term of years.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the federal Social Security Act, anyone guilty of making false statements or representations in applications for payments or benefits could face up to five years in prison, a fine up to $25,000.00, or both. In addition, anyone </span><b>offering, paying or accepting kickbacks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is guilty of a felony and could face up to five years in prison, a fine up to $25,000.00, and exclusion from federal health care programs for up to a year.</span>
