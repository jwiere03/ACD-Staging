<h2>Woman Going to Prison After Shooting Up McDonalds Drive-through</h2>
From all the bacon Christmas ornaments, bacon-flavored candy, bacon-print dresses and humorous bacon lover's slogans on T-shirts, it is safe to assume that people love bacon. There are even online bacon loyalty clubs like the Royal Bacon Society and Farmland, which offer everything bacon-related from recipes to gifts. But for all the bacon mania that has held the nation firmly in it's grip for decades, there is a point at which it can be said that one goes too far…

30-year-old Shaneka Monique Torres, a Grand Rapids-based bacon lover, had a recent incident at a McDonalds where her love of bacon overruled her common sense. As a result, she will now be going to prison for several years. And it is unlikely that bacon is served with any regularity there.<!--more-->

It all began in the morning of February 9th, at a McDonalds on 28th Street SE in Grand Rapids. Torres apparently ordered a bacon cheeseburger at the drive-through window, but what she received was a cheeseburger - sans bacon. She confronted the McDonald's employee and demanded that the problem be fixed.

She was promised that her next burger would be on the house, and naturally, it would come with bacon. However, when she returned a few hours later to collect on her debt, the second burger was missing that one, vital ingredient - bacon.

According to the testimony of the drive-through cashier, she had stepped away from the window to pick up the next order. That’s when a bullet tore through the glass and shattered the drive-through window. Had she not stepped away, she would very likely have been struck.

At first Torres denied having anything to do with the shooting when police questioned her. But after a few minutes, she admitted to having a gun.  And she did not have a concealed carry permit for it either. But she claims the gun went off accidentally while she was looking for her phone and wallet in her purse.

However, it only took the jury one hour to determine that Torres was guilty of felony firearm, which under Michigan law is punishable by a mandatory 2 years in prison. She was also convicted of shooting at an occupied building and illegally carrying a concealed weapon, which are both punishable by up to 5 years in prison.

Torres is scheduled for sentencing on April 21st in the Kent County Circuit Court, by Judge Paul Sullivan.
