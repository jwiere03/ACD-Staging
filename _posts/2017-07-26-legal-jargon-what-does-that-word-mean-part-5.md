And he/she sits on a bench, not a chair, in case you were wondering.[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaaaand we're back! Did you miss us? Of course you did! As we've pointed out before, if you're </span><b>a legal drama fiend or a who-dunnit addict</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then 'Netflix and chill' is a fantastic way to spend an evening (or the entire day…. did we say that out loud?) But who wants to watch hours of </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118437/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Practice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have no idea what's going on? Nobody, that's who. So The Kronzek team is here to help you out with a few basic explanations. You're welcome. Again.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Missed out on our series from the start? No big deal, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/legal-jargon-word-mean-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can catch up here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However for those of you who happen to remember </span><b>habeas corpus and nolo contendere</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, let's hit the road. Sick of Latin yet? (Seriously, what's wrong with you guys?)  Don't worry, we've got you covered. For this one we're keeping it simple, straightforward, and English only. Well, ...mostly.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Bench trial:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bench trial is a trial where there is no jury, and the final decision is made by the judge. The bench in bench trial refers to the judge's seat, which is formally called 'the bench.' Bench trials are usually requested by defendants when </span><b>they believe that a jury wouldn't actually provide them with a fair trial</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What's that you say? Jurors are required to be fair? True. But there are a few cases where a bench trial may actually give someone a better chance at a fair outcome. For example:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trial where the nature of the accusations (like severe </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, violent </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/aiccsp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-child-pornography-laws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child pornography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) may elicit such an emotional reaction from the jury, that it may be difficult for them to reach an unbiased verdict.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trial where the facts are very complex, and it will likely involve potentially complicated legal arguments, a defendant may feel that a bench trial is the better choice, because the judge is educated and experienced in considering convoluted information.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Concurrent sentence:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A concurrent sentence is a sentence that it served at the same time as another sentence. For example, if a Detroit man is found guilty of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed Robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and being a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felon in Possession of a Firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he may be sentenced to two different prison sentences. The general rule in Michigan is that sentences run concurrently and not consecutively. In some instances, the judge would have the choice of </span><b>sentencing a defendant to serve those two sentences concurrently</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which means at the same time) or consecutively (which mean one after the other.) Other times, consecutive sentences are mandatory. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Appellant:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This word has its root in "appeal." An appeal is the formal request made by someone who lost in court, and now wants </span><b>a higher court to review the judgment or verdict</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to make sure that it was correct. Which means that "appellant" is the person who makes the appeal.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a woman from Lansing is convicted of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Degree Murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but she claims to be innocent and says that </span><b>her court-appointed attorney did a terrible job of defending her</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (surprise...not really!). She may file an appeal. Hopefully, the Court of Appeals will review her case and rule that she is entitled to another trial with a different attorney. In this case, she would be the appellant.</span>
