Human trafficking charges were leveled at two people on February 25th in Southfield. A Florida man, Vinson Alexander, 30, was charged with human trafficking and assault of a woman from Texas. Alexander also faces several other felony charges related to the trafficking, including one count of torture. Police say that Taryn Johnson, Alexander’s 27 years old girlfriend and a Tennessee native, was Alexander’s accomplice and was also charged with human trafficking. If convicted on their charges Alexander and Johnson may face a maximum of life in prison and 10 years in prison respectively.
<h2>Promises of Well Paying Job Lead Victim to Violence</h2>
According to police, in December of last year Alexander and Johnson recruited the alleged victim to come up north with promises of a well paying job. Police say that the couple then forced the victim to work at an undisclosed strip club in the Detroit area, all the while stealing her pay. Alexander reportedly then maintained control over the victim by threatening violence, and he is accused of acting on those threats last week, assaulting the woman and seriously injuring her. The FBI is reportedly assisting Southfield Police in the investigation.

At the arraignment a 46th District Court Judge set bond at $1 Million for Alexander and $750,000 for Johnson.

There is an increase in the amount of prosecutions around the country. Michigan Human Trafficking defense attorneys are facing these charges with increasing frequency, especially in the southeast Michigan / Detroit area.
