The Clare County Sheriff's Department has begun an investigation into the events that left a woman dead, and her husband seriously injured. Â But what makes this particular situation so much more difficult is the fact that the man accused in this Clare County murder is their 43-year-old son. As a result, he is now facing murder and assault charges.<!--more-->

According to police, they responded to a 911 call about someone causing property damage and assaulting other people with a weapon. The caller claimed they were being attacked. Upon arriving at the home, police discovered that multiple windows had been broken.

But it was what they found inside the Greenwood Township home that made a bad thing worse. 64 year-old Cheryl Pouillon's body was discovered, stabbed to death. Her husband, 65 year-old Donald, was also stabbed and critically injured, but still alive. The weapon used was apparently a knife.


<h2>He was spotted and arrested while driving on the US 127</h2>

According to a witness, Scott Pouillon, who is accused of this crime against his parents, drove away from their home after the attack in a semi truck without a trailer. Shortly thereafter, he was spotted and arrested while driving on the US 127 in nearby Isabella County.

Scott Pouillon, a resident of Owosso, was arraigned in the 80th District Court before Judge Joshua Farrell. He has been charged with <a title="first degree murder" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide" target="_blank">first degree, premeditated murder</a> and assault with intent to murder. Under Michigan law, these are both felony charges, and come with very serious penalties for the convicted.

First degree premeditated murder is punishable by life in prison without the possibility of parole, while assault with intent to commit murder can be punishable by up to life in prison or any number of years.

There are very few details about this case currently available, and police are still investigating. So far, no motive has been made public. We will keep you updated as the case unfolds. Donald, Scott Pouillon's father, is apparently recovering in a hospital in Grand Rapids, but no details are available on his condition.
