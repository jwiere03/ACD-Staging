Just as parents are responsible for the actions of their children, pet owners can also be held accountable for their animal's behavior. One does not have to be a top criminal lawyer in Michigan to know that house pets, particularly dogs, can land owners in hot water. If the animal attacks a person causing bodily harm, the owner could be subject to criminal charges resulting in significant consequences, such as jail time. Michigan also has tough strict liability civil laws dealing with dog bites.

An example of this was seen recently when police arrested the owners of three pit bulls who attacked a young girl, causing immense injury to her. Tyah Norris, 6, frequently visited the home of Brian Nace, 35, and Jasmine Bailey, 19, to play with the couple's niece. However, during a recent trip, she was mauled by dogs in their fenced backyard. According to a University of Michigan Hospital spokeswoman, Norris' injuries required more than 500 stitches, landing her in serious condition.

According to relatives of Nace, the animals in question were not previously violent and had been around other children in the past without problems. On that day, adults in the home instructed Norris not to go into the backyard, which is decorated with "Beware of Dogs" and "No Trespassing" signs. Despite this, law enforcement officials and prosecutors have placed blame on Nace and Bailey, arresting them for criminal charges of keeping a dangerous animal that caused personal injury.

<h2>Michigan law defines a "dangerous animal" as one that bites or attacks a person or another animal, causing serious personal injury or death, while on the property or under control of its owner. </h2>
However, the law does not recognize an animal to be dangerous if it attacks while provoked, tormented or when a person is trespassing on private property.
Nace and Bailey were due in court and facing serious consequences if convicted. In addition to a $2,000 fine and the euthanization of their dogs, the couple may be required to complete 500 hours of community service and spend a maximum of four years behind bars â€“ despite their best efforts to keep the young girl away from the animals.

As seen by this example, an adult in a home can be held liable for the actions of animals living in the home. This shows how important it is to keep a close eye on your pets while visitors are around, to prevent unexpected attacks that could land you in legal trouble. If such a situation occurs in your home, it is essential to proactively seek knowledgeable and aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">Michigan defense attorneys</a>.
