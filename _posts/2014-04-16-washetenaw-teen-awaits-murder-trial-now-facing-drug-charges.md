<p dir="ltr">On February 22nd, just after midnight in the city of Saline, MI, Samantha Grigg was arrested for murder. She and two other teenagers, 18 year old Tyrel Bredernitz and 16 year old Brendan Heim, were charged with the murder of 19 year old Michigan State University student Dustyn Frolka. Frolka's body was found partially-clothed and unresponsive on the side of the Interstate 69 in Bath Township on February 15.<!--more--></p>
Police say the three teens intended to rob Frolka of money to buy drugs, but the situation changed for reasons not known to authorities, and he was instead beaten to death with brass knuckles and thrown from the moving vehicle. He was taken to Sparrow Hospital in Lansing and soon after, pronounced dead.


<h2>During the search police found two pill bottles</h2>

As a result, all three teens are currently facing charges of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">first-degree murder</a>, armed robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Grigg and Bredernitz waived their preliminary examinations, but Brandon Heim, who was charged as an adult, is awaiting a psychological examination. His hearing was adjourned without a date to allow time for the psychological evaluation which will determine his competency and criminal responsibility.

At the time of the arrest, Grigg's car was searched as it was believed by police to be the vehicle used in the murder. During the search police found two pill bottles containing 38 pills marked as dextroamphetamine. In addition, they also found a small bag containing 13.13 grams of marijuana. According to the police report, the search produced both drugs and equipment.

In addition to the murder and armed robbery charges, Washtenaw County Assistant Prosecutor Brenda Taylor has now authorized drug charges against Grigg, including possession with intent to deliver or manufacture marijuana, and an additional count of possession of analogues or amphetamines.

Under Michigan law, if convicted on the marijuana possession charge, Grigg faces up to four years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000. If convicted on the amphetamines possession charge, she could face up to two years in prison and a possible fine of up to $20,000.

The Washtenaw County charges have not yet been filed; and so no court date has been set for the arraignment in the 14A District Court. Grigg is currently being held in the Clinton County Jail where she awaits trial for murder and armed robbery in the Clinton County Trial Court. She is expected to accept a plea deal for those charges.
