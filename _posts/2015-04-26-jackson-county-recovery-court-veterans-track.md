<h2><b>Celebrating the First Graduates </b></h2>
One of the many things Michigan's legal system can be proud of is our network of 22 Veteran Courts, scattered across the state. But what exactly is a Veteran's Court? Well, it's a second chance with a new lease on life, for those who have served their country and then fallen on hard times.

The Veteran's Court is a sort of hybrid integration of drug court and mental health court, which works to help Michigan's veterans, and occasionally even active duty personnel, work towards sobriety, recovery, and stability. Still confused? No problem, lets break it down…..<!--more-->

One of the many challenges that military personnel face when they return from active duty, is resuming a "normal" civilian life. Many have emotional and mental trauma that they don't know how to handle and physical pain from injuries sustained in combat. Add to that the difficulty in finding a job. Many turn to drugs and alcohol to self-medicate. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where substance abuse leads. Which is why Michigan's prisons contain so many veterans. But this is where the Veteran's Court comes in.

In Jackson County, this is the Recovery Court, which now offers a Veteran's Track. Started just last year, the Veteran's Track aims to help veterans access services and treatment options through the court system. Overseen by Circuit Judge Susan Beebe, this court's primary purpose is treating addiction in order to break the cycle of substance abuse and criminal behavior.

How do they accomplish that? Well, it's hard work, make no mistake. But very, very important. The focus here is on recovery; addressing the root of the addiction, and then learning to cope with stress in healthier ways. Participants in the Recovery Court are encouraged to get and keep a job, lean on the support network during hard times, and work on creating a new positive outlook on life.

And three of them have succeeded. 68-year-old Doug Barker, 58-year-old Lloyd Nolen, 27-year-old Joshua Ohm are all veterans. But that's not all they have in common. After retiring from active duty, they all spiraled into substance abuse. Which led to dangerous choices. Like drinking and driving, which all three were arrested for.

But Recovery Court has changed that, and these three veterans are now the first three successful graduates of the Veteran's Track. All three will tell you that is was hard.  At some points it even felt impossible. But they are all back on track now. Free from the crippling addictions that ruled them and dictated their choices. Free to pursue life and all it has to offer.

We offer our sincere congratulations to Doug Barker, Lloyd Nolen and Joshua Ohm. We thank you for your service to our country, and we wish you well on your bright journeys forward in life.
