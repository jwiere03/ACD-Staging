<h2>Timothy Fradeneck Accused of Strangling Wife and Kids</h2>
Few crimes capture the noir aspect of the public's imagination, and spawn as many "true-crime" novels as the murder of one's own family. It is a subject that invites much morbid speculation, and a great deal of controversy about mental illness. 38-year-old Timothy Fradeneck, who is charged with strangling his wife and two children in their beds, has stated that he intends to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. But the outcome of his court-ordered psychological exam will determine how this really plays out.<!--more-->

According to police records, officers arrived at Fradeneck's home on April 13th to check on the welfare of Fradeneck's wife, whose sister contacted police when she didn't hear from her sister all day. Apparently a full day without contact was highly unusual. Fradeneck answered the door and told officers that his wife and children were sleeping. But the officers refused to leave. They insisted on seeing the children.

Finally, Fradeneck relented, and invited them in. And then admitted that they were dead. Officers found the bodies of Christie Fradeneck, along with 2-year-old Celeste and 8-year-old Timothy in their beds, strangled. Fradeneck admitted to killing them, saying he had strangled them with a USB cord. He also told officers that he had been planning their murders since August, and the opportunity had finally presented itself. He also said that he had planned to kill himself after his family was dead, but failed to follow through.

Fradeneck is currently being held without bond in the MaComb County Jail. He is charged with seven felonies in total - three counts of first-degree premeditated murder, two counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">first-degree felony murder</a>, and two counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">first-degree child abuse</a>. But the question on everyone's mind is why?

Prosecutors and investigators have all said that they have no idea what could have prompted Fradeneck to murder his family. Detectives have said that their was prescription medication in the home that was prescribed to Fradeneck. But when asked, he claimed to have no idea what it was for, or when last he had taken it.

According to details shared with the court by Fradeneck's attorney, Fradeneck suffers from bipolar disorder, along with other mood-related disorders. As examples of his mental state at the time of the murders, Fradeneck's attorney shared some details from that tragic night. Fradeneck apparently tucked his family members neatly into their beds after killing each one. He also allegedly placed a lego block in his son's hand and told him everything would be OK.

At Fradeneck’s MaComb County Circuit Court arraignment last month, his attorney requested a psychiatric evaluation prior to trial, believing Fradeneck was mentally ill at the time of the murders.  Fradeneck’s trial is currently scheduled for October 6, 2015.
