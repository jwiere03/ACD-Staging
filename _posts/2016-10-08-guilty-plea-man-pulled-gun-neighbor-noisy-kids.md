<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher C. Demetris, a Bay City resident, is facing single counts of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault with a Dangerous Weapon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reckless Use of a Firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, He is 56 years old and has accepted a plea deal. Demetris was </span><b>accused of pulling a gun on his neighbor because his kids were playing too loudly in the pool.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation that led to the charges against Demetris took place at about 4:45 pm on July 4th of this year in Bay County, Michigan. Police responded to a call from </span><b>a man who claimed that his neighbor had pointed a loaded weapon at him in front of his children</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Officers arrived on the scene to discover one very irate man who claimed that he was having problems with his neighbor, Demetris.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to what the man told police, </span><b>his kids were playing in the pool outside when he heard Demetris' sister curse out loud at them about how noisy they were.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upset, he went outside to confront her about using foul language in front of his children, at which point Demetris came to the door with a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loaded .45 revolver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the neighbor's version of the story, </span><b>Demetris pointed the gun at him and cocked the hammer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Demetris claims that the gun remained at his side throughout the confrontation. He also says that </span><b>the gun was unloaded and that he pulled the trigger several times to prove this point</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to his neighbor. He also made it known that he had a license to own the gun.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his explanation for why he brought a gun into the confrontation, </span><b>Demetris told police officers that it was for self defense</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "I came out on the porch with the gun because I don't know who this guy is. I am going to protect my family. I told the guy that we can take care of the situation this way."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, </span><b>the confrontation was diffused by Demetris' mother. She came out onto the porch and </b><b>apologized</b> to their neighbor. She later explained to police officers that her son has mental health issues and that <b>he used </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/medical-marijuana.html" target="_blank"><b>medical marijuana</b></a><b>  and methadone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With regards to the marijuana use, she explained that Demetris has a patient card and is completely legal in his use. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Charges Included a Misdemeanor and a Felony</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Demetris was arrested and charged with Felonious </span><b>Assault with a Dangerous Weapon and Reckless Use of a Firearm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under Michigan law, the later charge is a 90 day misdemeanor, while the former is a four year felony.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At his arraignment, after Bay County District Judge Timothy J. Kelly read the charges, Demetris </span><b>answered the Judge by saying that he understood the charges but that they were incorrect.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "I had no bullets in the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/illegal-discharge-of-a-firearm-in-michigan.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or nothing. I went out there to protect my mother. That's all." he explained to the court.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, </span><b>Demetris pled guilty to both charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In return, the prosecution has agreed to recommend to the Judge that he receive a delayed sentence with regard to the felonious assault charge. </span><b>The delayed sentence would last for one year, during which time he would be on probation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If he completes the probation successfully, the court will allow him to withdraw his felony plea and plead guilty to a lesser offense instead.</span>

&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This plea deal may or have not been a good deal for Demetris. Our criminal defense team says that the defendant </span><b>might not have been criminally responsible for his actions because of his mental condition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is not known whether Demetris had an experienced attorney advocating for him or whether his mental condition was taken into account before the plea. </span>
