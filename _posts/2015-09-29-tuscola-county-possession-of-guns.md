<h2><b>Tuscola County Man Also Had Body Armor</b></h2>
At about 1:30 on a Friday afternoon, a Tuscola County resident called the Sheriff's Department to report a break-in at their home. The individual had been out, and had returned home to find the house had been broken into in their absence. While on the phone with Central Dispatch, the caller also reported a suspicious man on a bicycle in the nearby vicinity.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuscola County Sheriff's deputies responded to the call and noticed a man on a bicycle in the area matching the caller's description. The deputies made contact and discovered he had a number of illegal items on his person. None of them, however, were stolen from the house where the break-in occurred.</span>

According to the Sergeant who arrested the man, there was a loaded handgun along with a broken down shotgun, ammunition, and ballistic armor in his backpack. In addition, it was discovered that the man had outstanding warrants for his arrest.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the sheriff's deputies were involved in investigating the break-in, Michigan State Troopers transported the man to jail. On the way to the jail, the man allegedly threatened to kill the deputy who had arrested him along with the troopers who were transporting him. He also threatened to attack the jail building once he is released from custody.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police are recommending a number of charges, including single counts of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possession of body armor by a felon, illegal possession of handgun and felon in possession of a firearm. Under Michigan law, all three of these charges are felonies. Interestingly, there has been no mention made of a resisting and obstructing charge resulting from the alleged verbal threats.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The man, who is a 43-year-old resident of the Akron area, has not yet been identified by law enforcement. Nor have any of his scheduled court appearances been made public. He is currently being held in the Tuscola County Jail, located in Caro, Michigan.</span>
