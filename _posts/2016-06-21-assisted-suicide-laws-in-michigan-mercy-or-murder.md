<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assisted suicide, which is sometimes referred to as euthanasia, or "mercy-killing", refers to suicide that is committed with the help of another person. According to the standard dictionary definition, the term "assisted suicide" is often used interchangeably with "physician-assisted suicide", which refers to a doctor intentionally providing an individual with the knowledge or ability to commit suicide. This includes providing counselling about the lethal doses of certain drugs, and also the prescribing or supplying of such lethal doses.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what does this have to do with criminal law in Michigan, you may wonder. Well, while it may be a rarely discussed topic, as it is not something that most people encounter outside of books and movies, it is a matter that the law has a very firm position on. Currently, there are only four states in the US that allow assisted suicide. They are Oregon, Vermont, Montana and Washington. The remaining forty six consider it a crime. In Michigan, assisted suicide is a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison or a fine of $10,000.00, or both.</span>

<h2>Some call that “death with dignity</h2>


<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are in favor of assisted suicide, they say it allows a person who is suffering from a debilitating disease or excruciating pain to select when they want to end that suffering. Some call that “death with dignity.” Celebrities like </span><a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Hawking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the well-known theoretical physicist who has spent 23 years on life-support battling ALS, and </span><a href="http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Pratchett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bestselling fantasy author who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, have spoken out in favor of the legalization of assisted suicide.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, Pratchett made a highly controversial documentary entitled "</span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1929387/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing to Die</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">", in which he discusses his diagnosis and talks about the fact that it should be legal for a person to choose when and how they want to end their life, without fear of prosecution of those assisting them. Hawking has made similar statements in interviews with the media, claiming that keeping someone alive against their wishes is "the ultimate indignity." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the only laws that exist in Michigan that allow any one person to make a life or death decision involving themselves or anyone else, is the designation of a patient advocate who may make the decision to have a patient removed from artificial life support. However, this decision must be made in accordance with the patient's living will, and be overseen by medical professionals. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, it was Michigan that gave the world it's most controversial assisted suicide case in the form of Dr. Kevorkian. Jack Kevorkian, a pathologist from Pontiac, Michigan, was arrested in 1999 for his role in a voluntary euthanasia case. He was convicted of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second degree murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison. In 2007, Kevorkian was paroled on the condition that he neither promote nor discuss the assisted suicide procedure. Dr. Kevorkian has since passed away. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, there is no indication that the law is going to change in Michigan at any point in the near future. But laws are affected by public opinion, and the tide is slowly turning when it comes to people's opinions on the issue of assisted suicide. More and more people are deciding that the right to life should also include the right to die. </span>
