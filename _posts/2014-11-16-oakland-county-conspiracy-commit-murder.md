<h2>Teens Charged with Hiring a Hit Man</h2>
Hiring a hit man looks easy in the movies. But real life is nothing like Hollywood's portrayal of reality, as two young Oakland County teens recently discovered, when they hired an undercover detective to perform a revenge killing on their behalf.<!--more-->

18-year-old Mia Rae Buscemi and her friend, 19-year-old Dallys Emery Vogel, were arraigned on November 6th in the Waterford Township District Court. They have both been charged with single counts of solicitation to commit <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">murder</a> and conspiracy to commit murder. Both charges are felonies under Michigan law and carry a penalty of up to life in prison.

The charges are the result of a failed attempt to hire a hit man to kill a Flint resident whom the girls believed was responsible for the shooting death of Buscemi's boyfriend, Wesley Gillmore. According to the Oakland County Sheriff's Office, they were alerted that the two young women were looking for a hit man, and so they set up a meeting with an undercover detective who posed as an assassin-for-hire.

The deputy met with the pair on November 4th at a coffee shop in Waterford, where the two apparently spelled out exactly who they wanted killed and how the murder was to be committed. They paid $2,000 in cash for the killing.

According to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, "Buscemi lost a boyfriend in a shooting at a party in Flint two years ago. The two women believe the man responsible got away with murder and were looking for street justice. They wanted him killed. They even bargained down the price."

After the meeting the two women were arrested by Waterford Township Police and taken to the Oakland County Jail, where they remain in custody. Defense attorney Pamela Johnson apparently requested a reduction in bail, which was set at $100,000 for each suspect, but Judge Richard Kuhn refused "due to the seriousness" of the charges.

Witnesses who were present during the arraignments say that Buscemi hid her face in her hands when she saw her friends and family in the courtroom, but Vogel apparently smiled serenely throughout the legal proceedings, seemingly unaffected by what was going on.

The two women appeared in court for their preliminary hearings at 1:30 pm on Thursday, November 13th.
