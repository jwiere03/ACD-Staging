<b></b>Nikey Dashone Walker and Shadeed Dontae Bey, a pair of 20-year-old Detroit area men, have been arrested and charged for beating up a man with cerebral palsy, and then posting the video of the assault to Facebook.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent history is full of examples of people who may just have got away with something they shouldn't have done, but the compulsion to share it online is what got them caught. And in the end, this duo is no different. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker and Bey are said to have stolen the cell phone of a suburban Detroit man who suffers from cerebral palsy. They then violently assaulted him and recorded the assault on the victim's phone. After it was over, they uploaded the video to the victim's Facebook wall, and also to their own Facebook walls. Which is how police knew who had participated in the crime.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the victim, Frankie Santana, the two young men spit on him, stomped on him and injured one of his eyes. They were also recorded using racial slurs and foul language during the assault. Thankfully, no bones were broken.</span>


<h2>They walked into the victimâ€™s apartment and assaulted him</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the police who investigated the incident, the two are believed to have followed someone entering the building in order to get inside. From there, they walked into the victim's unlocked apartment and assaulted him. The victim's phone, which was taken during the assault, was later found in one of the defendant's homes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released by the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, Sheriff Michael Bouchard expressed his sorrow and anger at what had happened. "Preying on those in our community who suffer from disabilities will not be tolerated and furthermore, to have the audacity to post their actions on the victim's page is beyond belief." </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Walker and Bey have been arraigned on charges of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">home invasion</a>, unarmed robbery, aggravated assault, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder</a>. They are both being held on bonds of $25,000, and if convicted, are both looking at the possibility of very serious prison time.</span>
