<h2>Dearborn Man Facing Charges</h2>
On Monday, June 30th, Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, a 36-year-old resident of Dearborn, MI, was formally arraigned on a felony charge of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. While Saad's intention may not have been to kill anyone, and the initial charge was for intending to cause harm but not to kill, tragically, the victim died the very next day after the arraignment.  Saad has now been charged with second degree murder because of this soccer ref death.

John Bieniewicz, a 44-year-old dialysis technician at Mott Children's Hospital and a soccer referee, was pronounced dead as a result of his injuries on Tuesday, July 1st. He was then kept on a ventilator until his organs could be harvested and donated through Gift of Life.

According to witnesses, the incident occurred at an adult-league soccer match at Miles Park on West Chicago Street in Livonia. Scott Herkes, who was playing on the opposing team, was standing about 30 yards away and saw what happened. "It was terrifying," he said. Apparently Bieniewicz stopped the game to eject Saad, who was facing his second violation in the game.

While Bieniewicz was looking down, attempting to pull out a red card, Saad punched him in the head, knocking him unconscious. Saad apparently fled the field immediately afterwards, driving off at high speed. A few of the players on the field noted his license plate number and provided a description of the vehicle.

Bieniewicz never regained consciousness after being struck in the head. According to James Acho, who has been a friend of Bieniewicz's for over 30 years, "The force of the blow to the jaw caused a traumatic impact to the brain."

Under Michigan law, assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both.   Now that Saad is charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">Second Degree Murder</a>, the penalties are even greater.   He faces up to life in prison.
