&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although most people have heard the term "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt" in movies, </span><b>many people still don't fully understand what it means</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although "legalese" can sound intimidating sometimes, this is actually a very simple concept, and one that's critical to the United States justice system.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you've been </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested and charged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a crime, there is a very strictly enforced series of steps that has to be taken before you can be convicted (or freed!). In felony cases, those steps start with presenting the evidence to a judge in order to </span><b>determine if there is enough evidence to take the case to trial</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is called preliminary hearing or a probable cause hearing. If the judge decides the felony case can go to trial, the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/court-appointed-attorneys"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prosecution and defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are now charged with creating convincing arguments that will sway the jury's opinion. (Misdemeanor charges skip this step.)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Where does "reasonable doubt" come into the justice system?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But exactly how convincing does the argument have to be? That's where guilty beyond a reasonable doubt means. In the United States, the prosecutor bears the burden of proof. This means</span><b> it's the prosecutor's job to prove to the jury that the defendant is guilty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the crime they're accused of. When they present their case, they must </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prove the defendant's guilt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the extent that there could be no "reasonable doubt" in the minds of the jurors.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What exactly does "reasonable doubt" mean?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn't mean that the jurors can't have doubts. It simply means that if the jury </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have doubts, they're small enough to not </span><b>affect a reasonable person's belief that the accused is guilty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A reasonable doubt isn't just a whim, or a possible doubt that can't be articulated. It is a real and genuine doubt that is based on common sense. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge reads this definition to all criminal juries in Michigan. “A reasonable doubt is a fair, honest doubt </span><b>growing out of the evidence or lack of evidence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is not merely an imaginary doubt, but a doubt based on reason and common sense. A reasonable doubt is just that ---a doubt that is reasonable, after a careful and considered examination of the facts and circumstances of this case.”</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If, after careful </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/evidence-101-how-fingerprints-tie-people-to-crime-scenes-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consideration of the evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and reasonable discussions among themselves regarding the facts of the case, </span><b>members of the jury still believe that there is doubt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the guilt of the accused, THAT would be a reasonable doubt. The existence of reasonable doubt requires a jury verdict of not guilty. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What happens when the jury has doubts about the accused's guilt?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the jury does have doubts that are significant enough to cause them discomfort about the guilty sentence, then </span><b>they haven't been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In those cases, the jury would return a verdict of "not guilty", which means that </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the accused is set free</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What role does a defense attorney play in this matter?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of the defense attorney is to ensure that the defendant is properly defended against accusations. This means </span><b>advocating for the accused</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ensuring that their rights and interests are protected, and that the law is practiced in the correct way. Without a defense attorney, someone accused of a crime is essentially a sitting duck.</span>
