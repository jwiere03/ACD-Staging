Dawn Marie Hahn, the 44-year-old mother who is currently facing multiple felony charges for the production and sale of methamphetamines, recently accepted a plea deal. Â She will be testifying against her husband in return for the dismissal of certain felony charges.<!--more-->

At her preliminary examination in the Missaukee County District Court, Hahn pled guilty to the charge of possession of meth and agreed to testify against her husband. In return, the prosecution has agreed to drop twelve additional felony charges in exchange for the meth plea, including the delivery or manufacture of methamphetamines, maintaining a drug house, operating and maintaining a meth lab in the presence of a minor, receiving and concealing stolen firearms, and possessing a firearm in the commission of a felony.

Hahn and her husband, 50-year-old Ronald Wayne Hahn, were arrested after the Missaukee County Sheriff's Department and Michigan State Police executed search warrants at their home on North Al Moses Road, near Lake City, on Thursday, August 28th .


<h2>Investigators also seized weapons and drugs</h2>

During the search, officers found a variety of chemical components and paraphernalia used in the production of methamphetamines, that were kept both inside and outside of the home. According to Detective Lt. Dan King of the Traverse Narcotics Team, investigators also seized other items from the house, namely marijuana, assorted prescription medications, several weapons including a Stevens Savage .22 rifle and a Ruger .22 single-six pistol, along with a stolen gun.

Also in the home at the time of the search was the Hahn's 4-year-old daughter. Child Protective Services (CPS) was contacted and the child was taken into the custody of the state. No information has been made available about where she is currently living, or whether the state is seeking to terminate the Hahn's parental rights.

Ronald Hahn is scheduled for his preliminary examination in the Missaukee County District Court later this month, while Dawn Hahn's sentencing has now been scheduled for November 3rd.
