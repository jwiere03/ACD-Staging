<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have questions about being on probation in Michigan, and about what it means to violate one's probation. Because there seems to be so much confusion about this subject, and because we believe that </span><b>the more you know, the better you can prepare for all eventualities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we compiled this list of common questions and answers about </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan. We hope this is helpful to you.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What's the difference between probation and parole?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Probation and parole are both considered to be alternatives to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incarceration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, the difference is that </span><b>probation occurs prior to, after, and sometimes instead of jail time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while parole only happens when someone is released from prison early.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People on parole and on probation are both supervised by law enforcement personnel called probation agents, probation officers or parole agents. They are also </span><b>expected to submit to warrantless searches without probable cause</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to follow certain rules and guidelines. These guidelines are referred to as conditions of parole, or probation conditions. Violating these conditions usually results in punishment, which could mean ending up back behind bars.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Who supervises people on probation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People on probation and parole in Michigan are both supervised by the </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Department of Corrections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Field Operations Administration. </span><b>Each individual who is put on probation in Michigan is assigned to a probation officer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who checks up on them, and ensures that they are following the rules.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Parole Agents coordinate needed services for the offender such as mental health treatment, substance abuse counseling, housing and employment. Probation officers supervise offenders who are convicted of certain misdemeanors and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felonies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>It is their job to ensure that the probationer complies with a specific court’s probation order</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike parole, where the conditions are the same throughout the state, the conditions of probation are set by the court where a defendant is assigned to probation.  </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>If you get probation, do you avoid jail completely?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to this is 'no.' However, there is no fixed rule regarding how the court may assign probation. In some cases a defendant may be sentenced to a term of probation only, or the court may choose to sentence a defendant to a term of probation in combination with jail time. </span><b>Jail, as a condition of probation, can be served immediately, or can be ordered at the end of probation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In most cases, jail time meant to be served at the end of probation is waived if the defendant is found to be in compliance with the conditions of their probation for a long period of time.</span>
