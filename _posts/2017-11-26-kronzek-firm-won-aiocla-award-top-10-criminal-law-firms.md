<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-26212" src="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/KronzekAward-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />The American Institute of Criminal Law Attorneys has recognized the exceptional performance of Michigan’s Criminal Law Firm, The Kronzek Firm as Two Years 10 Best Criminal Law Firm for Client Satisfaction.

The American Institute of Criminal Law Attorneys is a third-party attorney rating organization that publishes an annual list of the Top 10 Criminal Law attorneys in each state. Attorneys who are selected to the "10 Best" list must pass AIOCLA's rigorous selection process, which is based on client and/or peer nominations, thorough research and AIOCLA’s independent evaluation. AIOCLA's annual list was created to be used as a resource for clients during the attorney selection process.

One of the most significant aspects of the selection process involves attorneys' relationships and reputation among his or her clients. As clients should be an attorney's top priority, AIOCLA places the utmost emphasis on selecting lawyers who have achieved significant success in the field of Criminal law without sacrificing the service and support they provide. Selection criteria therefore focus on attorneys who demonstrate the highest standards of Client Satisfaction.

We congratulate The Kronzek Firm on this achievement and we are honored to have their firm listed as a Two Years AIOCLA 10 Best.
