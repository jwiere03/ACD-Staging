Read on to understand how this crime is charged[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, it is important that you understand one very important fact. </span><b>The word 'rape' has a definite meaning in the dictionary and in everyday speech</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it isn't a recognized definition in Michigan law. Ask around and most people would tell you that rape means forced, non-consensual sex. Michigan law doesn't define it that way.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, anyone who is charged with raping another person (forcing another person to engage in sexual penetration) </span><b>will be charged with either First or Third degree criminal sexual conduct.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are four 'degrees' of criminal sexual conduct in Michigan law, but only first and third degrees refer to the penetration of a victim. Second and Fourth Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct  refer to sexual touching without penetration.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How is rape charged in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, sexual penetration by force would be charged as Third </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Third degree CSC can become more severe if one or more factors are also present. Michigan law defines First Degree CSC as penetration of a victim when one or more other factors are present. These factors include: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victim being underaged, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perpetrator using force or coercion to achieve the penetration, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victim being related by blood to the perpetrator,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perpetrator being in a position of authority over the victim.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First degree criminal sexual conduct is punishable by up to life in prison. However, anyone whose sentence is shorter than life, and they are released back into society, will be </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required to register as a sex offender</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the rest of their lives.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What about the different types of rape?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because rape is a commonly used term, it has been divided into subcategories based on circumstance. For example, people talk about '</span><a href="https://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan-date-rape-laws-date-rape-defense-attorneys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">date rape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">', '</span><a href="https://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/rape-statutory-rape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statutory rape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">', 'spousal rape' and even 'child rape.' While all of these </span><b>may help the people involved in the discussion to clarify</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which form of sexual assault they are talking about, none of these terms are used in Michigan law.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a person sexually assaults another person by forcing them to participate in sexual penetration against their will, </span><b>whether they are on a date, under the age of consent, or married</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it will still be charged as Third degree or First degree Criminal Sexual Conduct in Michigan. Even 'child rape' (which is sometimes called child molestation) will be charged as First Degree CSC.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How is rape defended in court?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every case is different, so this isn't a question we can answer in a blog post. Constructing an effective defense against allegations of sexual assault is a very challenging, and very time consuming. </span><b>It requires creativity, tenacity, hard work, dedication and a lot of training</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also requires a great deal of experience. Attorneys who've never defended anyone against a sex assault allegation before,  usually can't provide the type of help you need.</span>
