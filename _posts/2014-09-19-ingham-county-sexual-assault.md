<h2>Lansing High School Student Charged</h2>
According to Ingham County Prosecutor, Stuart Dunnings, a Lansing Eastern High School student has been charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct and unlawful imprisonment. Although only 17-years-old, he is being charged as an adult.

Edward Darien Jackson, known as E.J. to his friends and family, is a senior and star running back for the high school football team, the Eastern Quakers. A spokesman for the Lansing School District has acknowledged that Jackson is being investigated for sexual assault, and has said that the incident that led to the charges occurred near Lansing Eastern High School.<!--more-->

Jackson's defense attorney, Jamie White, has gone on the record saying, "The allegations are shocking. Mr. Jackson has a reputation of being hard working and honest. There are two sides to every story and we look forward to presenting our story when appropriate."

Jackson was initially held on a $40,000 bond. When his family posted bail, he was released with the requirement to wear a GPS tether. Jackson's preliminary hearing is scheduled for October 6th, before Judge Patrick F. Cherry in the 54 A District Court in Ingham County.

Lansing Police say that the incident is still under investigation and are also asking that anyone with information about the events in question should contact Sergeant Christopher Baldwin at (517) 483-6846 or christopher.baldwin@lansingmi.gov.

Under Michigan law, first-degree criminal sexual conduct refers to forcible sexual penetration. It is a felony and punishable by up to life in prison. Unlawful imprisonment is also a felony and refers to keeping someone captive against their will. It is punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $20,000.00, or both.

As of yet, very few details regarding the event that led to these charges have been released to the public. However, as new details about the case emerge, we will make every effort to keep you updated on the progress of the case.
