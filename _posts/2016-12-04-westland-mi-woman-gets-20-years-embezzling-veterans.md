<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/former-credit-union-manager-charged-embezzling-2million.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuataina Afutiti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for embezzling $2 million from the Veterans Health Administration Credit Union, where she </span><b>worked as the credit union's president and chief executive. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is a resident of Westland, which is located near Detroit in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayne County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Court records reveal that the investigation started in February of 2016 after a routine audit. </span><b>Credit Union examiners from the State of Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) discovered issues which they suspected might be possible misconduct</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The subsequent investigation revealed a number of serious irregularities that Afutiti was unable to explain.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a press release from the Michigan Attorney General’s office, the alleged embezzlement that Afutiti was accused of took place between 2012 and 2016. They allegedly did not stop until the credit union closed in May of this year. Additionally, closer inspection of her </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-tax-evasion-attorneys-failure-to-pay.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that she used some of that money to </span><b>lease several vehicles and purchase a 2013 Mercedes Benz</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She also allegedly </span><b>bought a $100,000 motor home  and several expensive vacations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, </span><b>the total amount of money stolen by Afutiti from the Credit Union was $2,303,158.66</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This was the primary reason, claims A.G. Schuette, that </span><b>the Credit Union was forced into insolvency and required to close it's doors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May 2016. "For a person to take advantage of Michigan veterans, many of whom are disabled and on fixed incomes, to use the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/retail-crime.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to live a life of excess is despicable." Schuette said when addressing the media.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Afutiti was charged with single counts of Receiving Proceeds from a Continuing </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/retail-crime.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminal Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a credit union. </span><b>She later pled guilty to both charges, which may have been done in order to avoid a trial. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement is a very serious crime but the more serious crime in this state is the continuing criminal enterprise. In Michigan that conviction can result in decades behind bars if the prosecutor is successful in convincing a jury that someone stole money that wasn't theirs. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Afutiti was sentenced in the Wayne County Circuit Court before Judge David Groner. </span><b>She was ordered to repay $1.9 million in restitution, towards the $2.3 million she is accused of taking</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, she was also ordered to spend up to a total of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 years behind bars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Michigan state prison.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the sentence was handed down, A.G. Schuette made a statement to the press. "</span><b>This person not only took advantage of her position within the credit union but took advantage of military veterans, many of whom are disabled or on a fixed income.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Individuals who served and sacrificed for this country deserve the utmost respect and instead the members of the credit union were victimized. I am pleased to see this verdict."</span>
