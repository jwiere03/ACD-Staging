&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back, and thanks for joining The Kronzek Firm again as we reminisce about good movies and share </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fans-court-best-court-drama-movie-list-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our list of favorite court dramas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with you. In the previous article we shared our first 5 favorites, and here's the rest of the list. So put on your pjs, grab a bowl of buttered popcorn and settle in for a night of great trials and thrilling court mysteries.</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12 Angry Men</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This movie is unlike any other court drama or legal thriller around. Made it 1957, it was revolutionary then, and remains so today. The film deals with </span><b>the difficulties encountered by juries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they work towards a consensus. But what makes it such a singular film is that, with the exception of 3 minutes of the footage, the entire film takes place inside a single room, where 12 men (the jury) are attempting to work through the issues of guilt and innocence as presented by the court. Attorney Chuck Kronzek has lived out this very situation first hand having been selected as a jury member in a Michigan court. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the problems they deal with is a single jury holdout who won't agree because he fears it will lead to a miscarriage of justice. Although the case seemed to be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a simple murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning, it soons becomes obvious that </span><b>there is so much more to this story than meets the eye</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you love a good whodunit, then this one's for you.</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313542/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runaway Jury</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This movie also deals with a jury, but in this case, the issue isn't about establishing truth, but rather about </span><b>bending the truth to suit a personal agenda</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this case, the story appears to be a battle between a tort lawyer who is taking on</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the gun lobby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a jury consultant for the Defendants, both of whom are determined to assemble the best possible jury that will favor their arguments.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, one juror who makes the cut ends up on the inside with his own agenda. Between him and his girlfriend, who is </span><b>working on the outside</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to further their goals, they slowly bend the case and the jury to their own purposes. But what are those purposes? Well, you better watch the movie and find out...</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117913/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Time to Kill</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great movie that deals with the issue of motive in a murder case. A black man is on trial for murdering the two white men who </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raped his young daughter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The film follows the trial and </span><b>the work of his dedicated attorneys</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they work to convince a rather unsympathetic </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Starring Samuel L. Jackson, both Donald and Keifer Sutherland, Sandra Bullock and Matthew McConaughey, this film addresses major issues like race and justice in America. It also highlights a defense attorney who was </span><b>willing to put everything on the line</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to save a man he believed was innocent. Start popping the popcorn - you're going to love this one!</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find Me Guilty</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was an unusual role for Vin Diesel, but he did a fantastic job of it. With Peter Dinklage and Alex Rocco in the supporting cast, this story is thrilling! </span><b>Mobster Jackie DiNorscio</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, played by Diesel, is shot by his own cousin and later </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested for drug dealing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Facing 30 years in prison, he is offered a plea bargain that would grant him immediate freedom if he is willing to testify against his own family.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">DiNorscio refuses out of loyalty, and then chooses to defend himself at trial and forgo the help of an attorney. Although </span><b>we would NEVER recommend that anyone try to defend themselves in court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially when there's so much at stake, this film is interesting because it's based on a true story. In fact, the Jackie DiNorscio trial was one of the longest in US history. So what was the outcome? You'll have to watch it to find out...</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094608/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Accused</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This film, which stars Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis, tells the story of a young woman who was </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/aiccsp.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gang-raped in a bar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an incident that was watched and cheered on by numerous bystanders. She was able to </span><b>escape and report the crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the community took the assailant's side, and the prosecutor handling the case discovered that she had the deck stacked against her.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, despite unbelievable odds, the prosecutor is able to bring all four men accused of rape, and those who watched it happen, to justice. </span><b>The film was loosely based on the Gwen Araujo case</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although in that instance the victim was murdered and only her assailants were brought to justice.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you enjoy a few of these movies (we certainly did!). However, please remember that </span><b>movies are not anything like real life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you or a loved one are facing arrest, or have been arrested and charged with a crime, this isn't likely to have a fairy tale ending.
