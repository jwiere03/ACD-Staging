&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Desmond Ricks has spent the last 25 years in a Michigan prison. Why? Well, if you ask him, he'll tell you it's because </span><b>the police pinned a murder on him</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he was never guilty of. Looking at the evidence after all these years since his trial, it's hard to argue with his conclusion.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1992, Ricks was accused of shooting someone to death outside a restaurant in Detroit. Bullets were extracted from the body of Gerry Bennett, the victim, and then compared to a gun owned by Rick's mother. At trial, </span><b>a weapons expert told the court that the bullets removed from Gerry's body were a match</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to those test-fired from Rick's mother's </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.38-caliber gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In truth, however, they weren't even close.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Innocence Project at the University of Michigan’s law school persuaded the judge to reopen Rick's case last year. The reason? Looking at photographs of the two bullets taken from the victim clearly revealed that </span><b>they looked nothing like the bullets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examined by the gun expert at trial. So what was that all about? </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullets taken from the victim were still in storage 25 years later. Testing revealed that they were not a match for the gun owned by Rick's mother. Which means that </span><b>he couldn't have used her gun to shoot Gerry Bennett</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all those years ago. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which means that he had been innocent all along.</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">David Moran, director of the Innocence Clinic, went on the record and called the conduct of the police officers who investigated Gerry Bennet's death "criminal". And he was right. Ricks was nothing short of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">framed for a murder he didn't commit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unfortunately, as Moran also pointed out, it has been too long since the trial, and so </span><b>none of the officers involved can be held accountable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their actions.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it does raise another issue that needs to be addressed. The Detroit gun lab was shut down in 2008 after an audit revealed that botched analysis and sloppy work was jeopardizing cases. Which means that </span><b>Ricks had been right all along</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - the police lab did more than just a poor job of investigating Bennett's murder. They switched out evidence in order to gain a conviction - at the expense of an innocent man!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Moran, the Michigan State Police should make it a point to </span><b>investigate more cases that were handled by the Detroit police lab</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before it was closed down. Given that it's been less than a month since the last time we shared a story about </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/innocent-michigan-man-freed-41-years-prison.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a wrongly convicted Detroit man being freed after years in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it would seem that Michigan’s criminal justice system needs some serious work! This isn’t a unique story. This is happening all over America. </span>
