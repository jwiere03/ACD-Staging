<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again as we dig into the subject of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how </span><b>our current approach is making the problem worse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the previous two installments we looked at a couple here in Michigan who are working to raise awareness and change legislation that would allow loved one to force addicts into therapy. We also talked about the fact that </span><b>during America's '</b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank"><b>war on drugs</b></a><b>' the problem of addiction has become worse, not better.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Moving on, we are looking at a shift in points of view that doctors who work in the field of drug and alcohol abuse treatment are suggesting may help.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we discussed previously, Dr. Mark Calarco, the national medical director of </span><a href="http://americanaddictioncenters.org/branding/?keyword=american%20addiction%20centers&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;k_clickid=a6bbe2fb-64e0-4e99-8ef4-8a1c85d903be&amp;utm_campaign=Branding%20-%202016&amp;utm_source=google&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiA1b7CBRDjmIPL4u-Zy6gBEiQAsJhTMPHDDU4sUcKsxRc757dXzGQTzhddaIToIw-64SDvvmEaAiWD8P8HAQ" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Addiction Centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says that four things need to change. Those four things are </span><b>People, Cause, Stigma and Media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But what does that mean, exactly, and how can we change them? Everyone knows that talking about change is the easy part. Actual change is hard. So how can we in Michigan implement those changes? Let's take a look at the first item on the list…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The People:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Dr. Calarco, 'the people' in this instance are the ones struggling with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/vicodin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substance abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For the most part, </span><b>society sees addicts as 'dirty.'</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hollywood perpetrates the notion that addicts congregate in abandoned houses, where they share needles and other drug paraphernalia, and pass out in pools of their own vomit and urine. </span><b>They are often depicted as being sick, malnourished, and desperate enough to do anything for that next hit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-larceny-attorney-larceny-building-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stealing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lying and sometimes </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/prostitution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prostitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Indeed sometimes that does happen. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Movies like </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trainspotting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiem for a Dream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112461/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Basketball Diaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capture the dark, gritty underworld of drug addiction and 'junkies.'. A world that certainly exists in communities all over Michigan, but doesn't begin to represent the variety of people who struggle with addiction. </span><b>From our blue collar workers and housewives, to high school students and rock stars, the number of people who wrestle with substance abuse issues is substantial. </b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have only to spend a moment thinking about </span><b>the vast number of pop culture icons and celebrities who have died of drug overdoses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to realize that society often misrepresents those struggling with addiction. Cory Monteith, Lisa Robin Kelly, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Prince are a tiny sample of the rich and famous whose struggle with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substance abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cost them their lives. Lives that were not in any way 'dirty', 'disheveled' or 'desperate.' </span>

&nbsp;

<b>According to some theories, we need to change the way we view the people who struggle with addiction, or we will never be able to address this subject out in the open</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Until we Michiganders can see individuals who struggle with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as valuable people who desperately need help and care, then we will never be able to obliterate this scourge on our society. Drug users are people, just like you and your loved ones. The only difference is, they are fighting a terrible battle without the necessary weaponry or defenses to succeed. That’s why they need our help. Otherwise they, and many other hundreds of thousands just like them, will be lost. That’s not what Michigan people are all about. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us next time, as we look at the next two factors that would need to change in the public perspective in order for us to have a chance at combating drug use in the future. Until then, if you or a loved one have been accused of a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug related crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or any </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other illegal activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan, </span><b>contact us immediately at 866-766-5245</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
