&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for joining us again to discuss being on probation in Michigan. Based on the number of questions we have received from clients on the issue of probation and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation violations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan, we have assembled this </span><b>question and answer series addressing some of the more common concerns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Picking up where we left off <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-michigan-need-know-part-1.html" target="_blank">last time</a>, let's dive right in…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Is it my right to get probation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law is very clear about the fact that </span><b>probation is a privilege, not a right</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is described by the law “as a form of leniency" which allows someone convicted of a crime to continue to live in society, or to re-enter society after a period behind bars.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people may not realize it, </span><b>but probation (even though it can seem very restrictive) is a whole lot better than jail or prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you are on probation you get to live in your home, eat at restaurants, visit friends, go shopping, have a job, and engage in the behaviors and tasks that free civilians enjoy. None of these options are available to you </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">behind bars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>What does it mean to violate the conditions of my probation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each person who is granted probation by the court is given a list of rules and conditions that they are required to abide by. These are call the terms of probation. A probationer who doesn't follow the rules, or who does something that isn't authorized as part of their probation conditions, can be charged with a probation violation. </span><b>In many cases, violating probation is punished with incarceration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, either in jail or in prison.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What counts as a probation violation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a wide range of things that could count as a possible violation of your probation, </span><b>depending on what terms of probation the court imposed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some common violations include:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failing to pay court ordered fines or </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/restitution.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restitution</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being arrested for a new crime while you are on probation</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failing to complete a court-ordered program, like substance abuse counseling or anger management classes</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing your residence without authorization, or without notifying your probation officer</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failing a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or alcohol test (this is sometimes called a “dirty drop”)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">missing a scheduled appointment with your probation officer</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failure to appear at a scheduled court appointment</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaving the state without the prior permission of your probation officer</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">associating with a known </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/statute-of-limitations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failing to maintain school or employment</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every one of these will be ordered by the court for every probationer. However, these are very common probation conditions and you can expect that </span><b>most, if not all, of them would apply to you if you were placed on probation in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Violating a court ordered condition of your probation usually has serious consequences.</span>
