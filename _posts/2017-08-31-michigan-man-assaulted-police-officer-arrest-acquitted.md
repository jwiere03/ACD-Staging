<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever had one of those days where you get up in the morning expecting the day to go one way, and at some point </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/defenses-to-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an isolated incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sends it careening off in a totally unexpected direction? 20-year-old Diante Churchwell did. On July 10, 2017, the young Michigan man got out of bed and went about his business. The last thing he expected was to be arrested. Especially given the fact that</span><b> he hadn't committed a crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Churchwell's younger brother was arrested that day as well. In fact, he was arrested first, by a Kalamazoo police officer, allegedly for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">possession of narcotics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Churchwell, who was present at the time, was upset. He wanted to know why </span><b>his younger brother was being put in handcuffs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He approached the officer and asked what was going on. The ensuing altercation was recorded by a civilian witness.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Churchwell was upset. He raised his voice and got physically close to the arresting officer. The cop told him to stand down. Churchwell refused, continuing to ask questions about his brother's arrest in a loud voice. The officer got nervous, or frustrated, or both. </span><b>He told Churchwell repeatedly to step away, and was repeatedly ignored</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a situation like this, officers are entitled to deal with "aggressive persons" if they feel threatened or believe that they are at risk. But only in very specific ways. This particular police officer </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overstepped the bounds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The officer in question,Officer Derrick Turner, put his hand out and grabbed Churchwell around the throat. It only lasted a second, but </span><b>according to the Kalamazoo police procedure manuals,</b> <b>it was still over the line</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Churchwell was then arrested for allegedly </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-resisting-obstructing-attorneys-resisting-arrest-assaulting-police-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaulting, Resisting and Obstructing a Police Officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident was uploaded to social media, where it spread like wildfire. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Timeeko Churchwell, the boy's father, filed an 'excessive force' complaint. The Kalamazoo Police Department agreed that </span><b>the incident need to be investigated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they did so. Meanwhile, Churchwell sat in jail and waited to see what the outcome would be.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the Kalamazoo Police Department agreed that the officer had acted out of bounds. In addressing the media about the issue, Kalamazoo Police Chief Jeff Hadley said that the violation lasted only a few seconds. "He didn't skip a few steps, </span><b>he was confronted with an aggressive person</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who sought him out and didn't comply with our orders to step away. The guy was in an aggressive state. He (the officer) had every right to control that situation as a law enforcement officer. It was </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the method he used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do that, and only for a second, that's where it fell outside of the policy."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Churchwell was acquitted. A few days ago, he appeared in the 8th District Court in Kalamazoo before Judge Richard Santoni, and </span><b>was found not guilty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Assaulting, Resisting and Obstructing a Police Officer.</span>
