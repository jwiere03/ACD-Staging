  To solve difficult crimes, the Michigan
  State Police have been using devices
  that allow them to download the entire
  contents of almost any cellular phone,
  including the call log, text messages,
  photos and web history. Although the
  Cellebrite UFED is intended to assist in
  solving crimes, the ACLU (and every top
  criminal lawyer in Michigan) fears that
  the personal security of Michigan
  citizens could be compromised as a
  result.

The world in 2011 is largely a technological one, where people worldwide are connected to each other through electronic devices and the Internet. While living in a high-tech world allows people to share information faster and easier than ever before, every top criminal lawyer knows that problems can also arise from being too connected--what if your cellular phone contents were easily accessible for everyone to see?

Like the rest of the country, the state of Michigan is embroiled in its own debate regarding how much information should be accessible through electronic devices, particularly to law enforcement officials. To combat crime, state police use a device called the Cellebrite UFED that connects to almost any personal cell phone and downloads all of its contents (including call logs, text messages, photos, and web history) in just a few minutes. According to officers, the device has been incredibly effective in solving child abuse &amp; neglect crimes and other serious cases.
<h2>Opposition From The ACLU</h2>
However, the Michigan branch of the ACLU argues that the device could pose serious security threats, and that police are abusing the device and using it during routine arrests and interrogations without just cause. "We believe that [the police] are using new devices that allow them to extract information from cell phones without a warrant, and using them during routine traffic stops," stated Kary Moss, the executive director of the Michigan ACLU.

Spokeswoman Tiffany Brown for the Michigan State Police insists that these accusations are unfounded, and that "the [department] only uses the device if a search warrant is obtained or with consent. Still, the American Civil Liberties Union is far from convinced. To test their claims, the ACLU submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to review police records showing exactly how these devices were used and in which cases. Even though state police claim that they are working with the ACLU to compile the information, high costs and delays have done little to quell critic's fears.

As top criminal attorneys who defend people accused of criminal charges on a daily basis, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank">The Kronzek Firm PLC</a> Â is incredibly interested in how the debate over technological security will progress. Even though these devices may be helpful in some aspects, it is important that the personal security of Michigan citizens is not compromised by anyone, including the police. If you have been accused of any crime, including one involving technology or computers, you will need an experienced defense criminal lawyer to represent you. In addition to providing the best legal advice, skilled defense attorneys can ensure that your rights and freedoms are protected throughout the entire legal process, from initial questioning to trial.
