<h2>Home Invasion Just One in a String of Felonies</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Willie Anderson, when appearing at his most recent sentencing hearing, was informed by the prosecutor that the reason he is going back to prison for a very long time, is that he "didn't learn what they hoped he would learn."</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly had they wanted him to learn, you wonder? Well, Anderson was convicted back in 2006 of robbing a convenience store, at which time he also shot and killed the clerk. He was sentenced to prison, where he spent about six years before he was released on parole. But according to the prosecution, Anderson hardly waited any time after his release to resume his life of crime.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prosecution says Anderson was still on parole when he broke into the home of a woman, whom he then threatened with a gun, demanding her money. The woman said she had none and fled the house. Which is why she survived to provide police with his description. </span>

At Andersonâ€™s sentencing, the woman told the court that she had struggled ever since the home invasion and had difficulty sleeping at night. She said that she was just glad to get the whole ordeal over with. But she wasn't the only one who had something to say. The prosecutor had a thing or two to say as well.

"We would hope the time he'd served for taking a man's life would have had the effect society hoped it would have," Jackson County Assistant Prosecutor Nick Mehalco Jr told the court. But, he went on, "that's not what happened. He didn't learn what we were hoping he would learn."

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The jury at Anderson's most recent trial found him guilty on all counts, which is a substantial number or felonies. At the recent sentencing hearing, Judge Thomas Wilson sentenced Anderson to a maximum of 40 years for single counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">first degree home invasion</a> and assault with intent to rob while armed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the Judge also sentenced Anderson to two years for each of the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felony firearm</a> convictions, and another pair of sentences of up to 7 and a half years for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Finally, he also handed down additional sentences for carrying a concealed weapon with unlawful intent and for resisting and obstructing police. All in all, Anderson is looking at a very minimum of twenty-six years behind bars.</span>
