As the government, courts, and prosecutors continue their "war on drugs," one does not need to be a <a title="Top Criminal Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">top criminal lawyer</a> to know that being accused of a drug crime is a big deal. Although the punishments vary depending on the amount and type or "Schedule" of the narcotic(s) involved, conviction of any drug crime will change one's life forever, likely resulting in excessive fines and lengthy prison sentences.

Because law enforcement officials cannot be everywhere at once, police often use tips from individuals who witness suspicious activity and report it. Such are the circumstances in a recent case that came to the attention of every Michigan drug defense lawyer; after receiving tips from Lansing postal workers, police arrested four individuals in connection with <a title="Drug Defense Lawyer" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank">marijuana drug crimes</a>.

<h2>Postal workers are always on the lookout for suspicious items</h2>

Those handling the mail are always on the lookout for suspicious items that could be illegal, dangerous, or both. Should they suspect something is wrong with a package or piece of mail (such as that it contains drugs, or other illegal substances), they will immediately report it to police. Despite the risks of sending drugs through the mail, many defendants of drug crimes were caught this way.

In this particular case, Lansing postal workers tipped off police that packages containing huge amounts of marijuana were being delivered to a local home. This information was sufficient for police to obtain a search warrant to investigate the residence in question. During the search, law enforcement officials seized 16 pounds of marijuana and arrested four people in connection with the drug crime--two men from Flint, and a man and a woman who lived at the residence being searched. Because children were also living in the home where illegal activity was being conducted, the kids were taken from their parents and placed with relatives.

As seen by the case described above, accusation of drug crimes in Michigan can have serious consequences. Besides high fines and possible incarceration, one's parental rights can be put in jeopardy.
