<h2>Howell Township Woman Pleads Guilty</h2>
Margaret Elaine Komorny, a 77-year-old woman from Howell Township, MI, has pled guilty to a felony charge of animal cruelty. The plea was entered on Tuesday, June 2nd, in the Livingston County District Court. Komorny is now facing a potential 4 years in prison, in addition to fines of up to $5,000 and 500 possible hours of community service.

The charges stem from discoveries that were made when authorities raided Komorny’s Livingston County farm. They had received multiple reports regarding animal neglect at the property known as Raisin Tree Farms.

Authorities found 91 dogs and puppies. They were living in what was described as "disgusting conditions" by Animal Control Officers. The dogs were kept in overcrowded cages stacked on top of each other, with bedding that was soaked by urine and feces. Additionally, many of them were in poor health and needed veterinary care for a variety of medical issues, including ear infections, burst ear drums, mammary tumors, roundworms, whipworms, rotted teeth, muscular atrophy, umbilical hernias and scalded testicles from matted feces.

Initially Komorny denied the allegations, saying that “none of the dogs” taken by the Livingston County Animal Control officers were experiencing any of the medical conditions claimed by the court. According to her statement, she did not run a "puppy mill", but rather a legitimate kennel that sold dogs online.

Two of the dogs died as a result of their conditions. The remaining 89 animals have been distributed to local shelters and pet rescue organizations for care. During a forfeiture hearing on Tuesday, June 3rd, Komorny relinquished her rights to the animals. This frees them up to be adopted from the shelters where they are now kept, once their health has been assured.

On the same day in the afternoon, Komorny returned to court for a preliminary hearing on one count of animal cruelty to 10 or more animals. She pled guilty to this charge. Her <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank">sentencing</a> has been scheduled for July 17th.
