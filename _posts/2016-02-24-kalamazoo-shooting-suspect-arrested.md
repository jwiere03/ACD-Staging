Jason Brian Dalton, a 45-year-old resident of Kalamazoo, has recently been arrested for what police are saying was a shooting spree that took place in three separate locations around the county. Dalton, who is a former insurance claims adjuster and current Uber driver, is accused of shooting six people, four of whom are now dead.<!--more-->

According to police reports, Dalton's first shooting incident took place at Meadows Townhomes, at about 6 pm. A woman was shot multiple times and is said to be badly injured, but expected to survive.

The next shooting happened about four hours later at Seelye Kia of Kalamazoo, where a father and his 17-year-old son were gunned down while they looked at cars. Police say that another person was injured but not killed in that attack as well.

And the final incident took place in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel Restaurant, located just off I-94. This one happened only 15 minutes after the car dealership shooting. There, four women were shot and killed, and a 14-year-old girl was badly injured. She is currently in the hospital in critical condition.


<h2>Jason arraigned on murder, felony firearm and assault</h2>

According to police, there appears to be no known link between the shootings and the shooter, which leads them to believe that these killings were random. The investigation only lasted one day, before Dalton was arrested and transported to the Kalamazoo County Jail. He has been arraigned on murder, felony firearm and assault with intent to commit murder charges.

Dalton, who is said to be married with two children, was arrested without incident the day after the shootings. Kalamazoo County prosecutor Jeffrey Getting has not released a lot in the way of information about what evidence the prosecution has against Dalton. The reason, he explained, is because this is a very sensitive investigation, and he is determined to do this "by the book". "This is obviously very, very tragic circumstances. We wouldn't want to do anything to jeopardize our ability to prosecute Mr. Dalton," Getting stated
