<b>First Degree Murder in Child Abuse/Torture Case</b>

It was a case that enflamed the media - two little girls, starved and dehydrated, one already dead and the other suffering from malnourishment, pneumonia and severe infection. In the word of the Port Huron Police Chief, Michael Reaves, one death was a "tragic homicide", while the other was "prevented" by the arrival of law enforcement. But what really happened?<!--more-->

5-year-old Mackenzie Maison was declared dead by the time she reached the hospital, while her 3-year-old sister was admitted in critical condition. That, however, is most of what we know. As of yet, there is very little in the way of new information about this case. But the prosecutor's office recently announced that they had upgraded the charges against Hilery and Andrew Maison, the parents of the two girls, to <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">first degree murder</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where before the couple were faced with charges of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank">open murder</a>, child abuse and torture, the new designation on the murder charge implies that Mackenzie's death was a direct result of the abuse and torture she allegedly sustained at their hands. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Senior Assistant Prosecutor, Mona Armstrong, the new first degree murder charge simply defines the existing charges more specifically. </span>

But it also increases the amount of possible time the Maisons may spend behind bars if convicted at trial. Open murder means that the jury is left to decide whether the defendants should be charged with first or second degree murder. And the state sentencing guidelines for second degree murder specify "any number of years, up to life", whereas first degree murder is a guaranteed life sentence, without the possibility of parole.
<h2>Where the Case Begins</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The case began when Hilery Maison called 911 because her step-daughter, Mackenzie, was unresponsive. Police arrived to find four children - two starved little girls, two perfectly healthy little boys. The girls, biological children of Andrew Maison, were described as severely underweight. Mackenzie, who is now deceased, was only 25 pounds, where a normal 5 year old would be about 40 pounds. Makayla only weighed about 17 pounds, but should have weighed in at a minimum of 32 pounds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Makayla, who survived her sister, was diagnosed with pneumonia, dehydration, and malnutrition. Oddly, the other two children, who are biologically Hilery Maison's sons, were in perfect health. All three surviving children have been removed by CPS and placed in foster care. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew and Hilery Maison are scheduled to appear in the St. Clair County Circuit Court for their pretrial hearing on January 11th, with the trial set to begin on January 20th. Until that time, they are being held without bond.</span>
