Most women like chocolate, or flowers, or silly stuffed toys for Valentine's Day. But not Patrick John Bergeron's wife. No, to mark that most commercialized of romantic occasions, she wanted her wrists slit. And her husband, ever the sentimental, obliged her. But as it turns out, assisted suicide is illegal here in Michigan, and Bergeron is looking at felony charges as a result.<!--more-->

According to Sheriff's deputies in Isabella County, the love-struck couple were apparently lamenting the fact that, although they were married, no one seemed to think they should be together. No information is provided to explain this, but regardless, it apparently had them very upset.

And so they decided to take matters into their own hands. Unfortunately, the matters in question was a double suicide. The couple decided to get seriously intoxicated together and then slit their wrists. But as the saying goes, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry...

After downing 20 Xanax pills, Bergeron's wife realized she didn't have the guts to go through with it. So she handed Bergeron the box cutter and asked him if he would do it for her. Bergeron, who had just consumed a fifth of whiskey, obliged her.


<h2>Deputies arrived to discover the couple bloodied and inebriated</h2>

But the plan began to unravel when Bergeron's wife sent a "goodbye world" text to someone, who reported the message to 911 and requested a “well being check.” As a result, deputies arrived to discover the couple bloodied and inebriated.

Bergeron and his wife were both transported to McLaren Central Michigan hospital. They were treated and then released. But Bergeron was summarily arrested for his crimes, not least of which was parole violation. Apparently, the mere act of having a drink on Valentine's with his wife was a violation of his parole. He is currently being held in the G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility in Jackson.

45-year-old Bergeron was later arraigned on two felony charges in the Isabella County Court. The first, intent to assist an individual with suicide, carries a punishment of up to five years in prison and a possible fine of up to $10,000 fine. The second charge, carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent, is punishable by the same maximum number of years in prison, but a lower fine of $2,500.

Shakespeare's Othello offers us the famous quote, "He loved not wisely, but well" which may indeed be the case here. So for all you lovebirds out there, please bear in mind that while love may know no limits, the law does. And you can get into a lot of trouble if your commitment takes you beyond the limits of the law, so the best thing you can do is stay informed and make wise choices.
