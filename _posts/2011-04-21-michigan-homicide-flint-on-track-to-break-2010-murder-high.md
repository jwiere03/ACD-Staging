Recently, police in Flint, Michigan announced the shooting deaths of three men. That brought the number of homicides in the Flint area to twenty-one. In 2010, the number of Flint homicides for the same time period was seven. If this year’s high rate of homicides continues, Flint is on track to surpass its record number of yearly homicides set in 2010 at sixty-six.

Flint Mayor Dayne Walling stated, “It’s a tragedy that so many lives are being lost to senseless violence on our streets.” Mayor Walling believes the high number of homicides in the Flint area highlights Flint’s continuing drug and gun problems.

<h2>Public pressure to fight homicides will lead prosecutors in Flint and Genesee County to aggressively pursue homicide investigations and prosecutions</h2>

As Michigan criminal defense attorneys, we know that people charged with a homicide crime need to find a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html">criminal defense lawyer</a> who will work harder that the prosecution.

Michigan homicide charges—including first degree murder, felony murder, second degree murder, and manslaughter—are some of the most serious Michigan criminal charges one can receive. That causes some criminal attorneys to shy away from defending these clients. When selecting a defense lawyer, make sure they have a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html">proven track record</a> of defending serious felony charges. Murder charges often involve complicated issues presented by DNA, ballistic, and CSI experts. A criminal defense attorney should have competence dealing with technical and scientific evidence. The Kronzek Firm attorneys have developed an extensive network of expert witnesses who can assist our clients with various types of scientific testimony.
