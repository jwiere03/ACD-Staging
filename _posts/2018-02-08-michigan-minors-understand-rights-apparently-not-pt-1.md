&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids in Michigan watch a lot of TV. And movies, and YouTube videos, and countless other sources of entertainment. But while the average teen has probably seen </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many people arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both in films and in TV shows, and in live recordings posted online, do they really understand what they're seeing? </span><b>Do they know what it means when an officer reads someone their rights?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The answer, it seems, is unfortunately not.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Teens simply do not grasp the full implications...</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, the American Academy for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry conducted a study on juvenile understanding of Miranda rights. Their conclusions? T</span><b>he rules are simply too complex for minors to fully grasp.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is not to say that teens aren't intelligent, or that they're not smart enough to understand advanced concepts. In many cases they are. But when it comes to Miranda rights, the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">far-reaching consequences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are just to complicated for the average teenage brain to grasp. When you add the still-maturing, nervous teenage brain to a scary, unexpected encounter with a police officer, it’s easy to see why the kids just don’t get it. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This may not seem like a big deal to some, but when you consider how many teens are arrested here in Michigan alone on an annual basis, the implications are massive! According to the </span><a href="http://michigancommitteeonjuvenilejustice.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Committee on Juvenile Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>10,728 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in 2016</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The number has only grown since then. With that in mind, consider how many young people have interactions with the police, without fully understanding their rights. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Misunderstanding one's rights can lead to false confessions!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How many teens have made false confessions of guilt because they don't understand what's going on? Or shared details that implicate themselves in crimes that they didn't have to discuss with</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><b>How many teens are sitting behind bars right now, here in the Great Lakes state and around the nation, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">because they didn't understand the full implications of their Miranda rights? The number is truly mind-blowing!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in January of 2017, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-confessions-lie-isnt-actually-lie-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we shared a series with you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that discussion the issue of false confessions to crimes. One of the facts we covered was that falsely accused suspects who end up confessing have usually been t</span><b>reated aggressively, frightened, threatened, and lied to</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how much </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/private-investigators.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">supports the claim against them. They are bullied and coerced into confessing to something they didn't do. And if you know anything about teens, you know that they are highly suggestible, and easily influenced!</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>There is a higher rate of false confessions among teens than adults!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another article we shared with you some time ago dealt specifically with the issue of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-convictions-among-juveniles-terrifying-facts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">false confessions among juveniles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As we pointed out then, Steven A. Drizin, a clinical professor of law at Northwestern University, says that about 13% of adult wrongful convictions stem from false confessions, while </span><b>42% of wrongful convictions among juveniles are the result of false confessions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Which means that almost half of the juveniles behind bars today, are there because they confessed to crimes they didn't commit! This statistic is horrifying! We certainly don’t want any Michigan kids behind bars for something they did not do. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what can be done about it? Is there a way to solve this problem, and protect the youth of Michigan and our nation as a whole in the future? It seems there may be.
