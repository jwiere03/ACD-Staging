<h2><b>Murder Suspect Rams Police Cars With Stolen Army Vehicle</b></h2>
Gregory Allen Rose, the 46-year-old suspect in a Michigan murder, was recently arrested in Carlton County Minnesota. But he didn't go down without a fight. And he may face even more charges as a result.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The murder, that originally led to charges against Rose, took place in Midland County. A November 14th house fire was contained and extinguished, before authorities discovered the body of a woman inside. The deceased woman, who was also the homeowner, is believed to be the victim of a homicide. Officials are also certain that the house fire was intentionally set. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police are saying that the homicide and murder are in some way linked to a prior felonious assault that they were investigating in Midland County. Rose is believed to have made his getaway from the murdered woman's home driving her Ford Escape, which is still unaccounted for. Shortly after the investigation began, Rose was named as a murder suspect. </span>

Rose was recently paroled on a 30 to 60 year sentence for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html" target="_blank">criminal sexual conduct</a> (CSC) and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank">armed robbery</a>. However, he was quickly considered to be a parole absconder, and was being searched for by police in connection to an alleged <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">aggravated assault</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose was arrested on a rural county road after leading Minnesota State Patrol troopers and local authorities on a wild chase that almost reached 100 miles per hour. Rose was behind the wheel of a black government issue truck, which had been reported stolen by the Army Corps of Engineers in Wisconsin over the weekend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It began when a state trooper tried to pull him over for speeding just after 7am, and he declined to stop. In the end, a number of departments were involved in the chase, including Carlton County sheriff's deputies, officers from the Moose Lake Police Department, Minnesota State Patrol and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he was finally arrested, Rose rammed several of the squad cars with his stolen truck, causing enough damage that two of them needed to be towed. He also ran another officer off the road. At the time of his arrest, Rose is said to have not resisted officers, and also not used any weapons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He is facing charges in Michigan and also in Minnesota. Currently there is no information regarding when he will be extradited to Michigan to face charges.</span>
