<span style="font-weight: 400;">We regularly have people contacting The Kronzek Firm about </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/protection-orders.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Protection Order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s (PPOs), asking questions, and trying to figure out if they even </span><b>need our help</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with this. As such, we'd like to take a moment to answer a few questions you may have about PPOs here in Michigan, and address a couple of your concerns.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, we want to point out that while it's entirely possible, and completely legal in Michigan, to </span><b>ask the court for a PPO on your own without an attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we don't recommend it. Understanding the law about Michigan Personal Protection Orders is only the first step, and it includes understanding both the statute and the requirements you need to meet in order to have the court grant you a PPO.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing exactly what needs to be filed, along with where and when the filing needs to happen, can be really confusing. Making even the smallest mistake on your paperwork can mean rejection of the request and other complications down the road. </span><b>Providing incorrect information, or not enough information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can mean delays in getting your PPO signed by a judge. This can mean even longer periods of time where you're not protected from someone who might </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hurt you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Complicating all of that is the fact that different kinds of PPOs requires different allegations and procedure. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three most important aspects of getting your PPO, are:</span></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the order signed by a Circuit Court judge. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing legal notice of the court's order to the person that has been restrained. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following up with local law enforcement agencies to make sure that they've entered the order into LEIN (Law Enforcement Information Network)</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgetting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these steps, or not completing them properly, can interrupt your process. Unfortunately, there are no exceptions. </span><b>A PPO </b><b><i>must</i></b><b> be signed by a judge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; the person you're hoping to be protected from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be notified of the order, and you really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> follow up with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> afterwards. Note that in an unusual step, the Michigan legislature created the Personal Protection Order law such that it is effective as soon as the judge signs it. However, many judges will not enforce a PPO unless the person being restrained knows about the PPO having been signed by a judge. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the judge requires a hearing in order to hear the evidence against the person you're seeking protection from (called the “Respondent”), you (called the “Petitioner”) must be able to provide that evidence. </span><b>The court will not accept "hunches" and "gut feelings"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have evidence that the person </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened to harm you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has continuously harassed you or that some other statutory basis exists for the court to grant your request (called a “Petition”). Also, that evidence has to be properly presented to the court in conformance with the Michigan Court Rules and the Michigan Rules of Evidence. .  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When providing the court with evidence, having witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the facts increases the credibility of your story. If you're uncomfortable trying to learn the law to properly present your case to the Court, remember, </span><b>lawyers spend years learning about the law </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and court procedures, and understanding the Michigan Rules of Evidence. So if you aren't comfortable representing yourself with authority, you will definitely need an attorney!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, either side, you (the "petitioner") or the Respondent, are allowed to request a hearing, if you want one. Bear in mind that both you and the person you are seeking protection from (the “respondent”) </span><b>have to be present at all PPO hearings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You'll both be given an opportunity to speak. If you don't have an attorney representing you in court, you'll need to take your own notes, present your own case properly, properly offer your own evidence, learn how to cross examine a witness and be prepared for a formal legal proceeding. </span>

&nbsp;
