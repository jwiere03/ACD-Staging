Kiefer Olger, a 27-year-old Lansing resident and self-professed full time drug dealer, was recently sentenced in the Ingham County Circuit Court for causing a man's death. According to the prosecutor, it was Olger's heroin that killed 20-year-old Jonathan Singer, which is why he is considered to be guilty of murder.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation began back in September of 2013, when Singer purchased heroin from Olger, and died of an overdose the very next day. Law enforcement agents from several agencies began an undercover operation in which they were able to purchase <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank">heroin</a> from Olger, which proved that he was selling the drug. But it was the verbal admission they were able to capture of his having sold heroin to Singer the day before he died, that sealed the deal.</span>

<h2>Police rarely able to bring charges for a drug related death</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Olger was arrested in November 2013 and charged with delivery of a controlled substance causing dea</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th, which is a very serious felony under state law. According to Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III, police are rarely able to bring charges against someone for a drug related death. But on those occasions when the opportunity presents itself, they rise to the occasion.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Olger was found guilty by an Ingham County jury in November 2015, and sentenced just days ago by Circuit Court Judge William Collette. Although the death took place in DeWitt, which is located in Clinton County, the charges were brought in Ingham because that was where the initial heroin sale took place. </span>

Collette gave Olger a sentence of 18 years and four months, to 33 years and 4 months for the delivery of a controlled substance causing death charge. For the remaining two drug related charges, Olger was granted minimum terms of four and five years consecutively. The judge also ordered that the three sentences will be served concurrently.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addressing the court during the sentencing hearing, Judge Collette said that he couldn't understand why people still believed that drug dealing was a victimless crime. He also referred to Olger as "one of the more dastardly people" who had appeared in his courtroom.</span>
