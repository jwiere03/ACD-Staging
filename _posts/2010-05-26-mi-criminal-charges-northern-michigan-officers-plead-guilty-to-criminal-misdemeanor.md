If a worker fails to perform his or her job appropriately, that person will almost certainly face consequences, such as being fired. However, if the individual is employed by the city, such as a police officer, they will undoubtedly have larger problems. Experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers can attest, breaking the rules as a police officer will result in criminal charges, with harsh punishments--not only is their job and reputation at risk, but legal consequences will almost certainly result. A perfect example is seen in the recent case of two Northern Michigan law enforcement officials who pled guilty to misdemeanor criminal charges after failing to perform sobriety tests on an off-duty officer.

In the early morning hours of February 7th, Traverse City Police officer Joseph Soffredine was driving along Cedar Run Road when he missed a curve and barreled into a wooded area. The two cops who responded to the crash was Robert Sillers and Mark Noffke were placed with a difficult decision--do they write up their superior and colleague? According to court documents however, the two officers neglected to perform sobriety tests on Soffredine, nor cite him for driving with expired license plate tags. Additionally, they wrote onÂ  their police report that the accident was caused by icy roads, when witnesses reported that the roads were clear.


<h2>Officers still had a responsibility to enforce the law</h2>

Although 86th District Court Judge John D. Foresman acknowledged that the men may have been influence by the older and more experienced Soffredine, they still had a responsibility to enforce the law, even upon another officer. "You slacked on your duties... So while I can understand how it happened, it can't happen, and it's wrong, and you guys have got yourself in some difficult situations because of that," Judge Foresman explained.

Despite their admirable intentions, the two men pled guilty to a count of neglecting to perform the duties of a public officer. Although this is a criminal misdemeanor that could result in 90 days behind bars, Judge Foresman sentenced the men to pay a $550 fine, believing that they had already suffered enough--not only has the local media criticized the men heavily, but they were also fired from their jobs because of the incident.

As seen by the example of Robert Sillers and Mark Noffke, a city-employee can face serious problems for not performing their job appropriately. Conviction of these charges will have life-changing consequences, including fines, jail time, or even the loss of employment.
