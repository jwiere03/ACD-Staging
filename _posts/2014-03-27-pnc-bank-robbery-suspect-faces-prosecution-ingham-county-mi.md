<p dir="ltr">Early in March a PNC branch bank on West Mount Hope Avenue in Lansing, Michigan was robbed at gunpoint. The suspect approached a teller and indicated that he had a weapon. The teller handed over an undisclosed amount of cash and the man fled the premises on foot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lansing Police officers attempted to track him with a canine unit, but the dog only led them to the tracks left by the get away car. His description was released to the public in the hopes of identification that would lead to an arrest.</p>
