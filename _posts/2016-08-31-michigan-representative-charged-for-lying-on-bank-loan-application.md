<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/misconduct-charges-against-former-legislators-tossed-out.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courser/Gamrat sex scandal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that blazed through the Michigan media for months, the debacle where </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/court-updates-senator-virgil-smith.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State senator Virgil Smith</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shot at his ex-wife's car, and the business with both the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/newaygo-county-commissioner-facing-felony-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newaygo County Commissioner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bay-city-commissioner-convicted-of-larceny.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay City Commissioner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who faced charges for larceny and destruction of property, </span><b>Michigan politics seems to have had a rough run</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alas it appears we're not done yet. </span><b>State Representative Brian Banks of Harper Woods</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also up against a wall, and this one seems to be about falsifying information on a bank loan.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, Banks was arraigned recently in the Wayne County Circuit Court on two felony counts of Uttering and Publishing, one felony count of Using a False Pretense to Defraud or Cheat, and one misdemeanor count of Making False Statements of Financial Condition.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The story behind these charges began some time ago.  Banks allegedly used fake pay stubs to apply for a loan in 2010. According to court records, Banks applied for a loan from the Detroit Metropolitan Credit Union in June of 2010, but </span><b>provided the bank with falsified pay stubs that from a law firm where he had never actually worked</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The loan, which totalled $7,500, was allegedly used to pay for a review course that Banks wanted to help prepare him to take in order to pass the Michigan Bar Exam. IHI Consultants in Farmington Hills, which was </span><b>the law firm that Banks claimed to have worked at, is owned and operated by a long-time friend</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Banks'. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During Banks' recent preliminary examination, </span><b>the owner testified to the court that Banks had asked her to create a number of falsified pay stubs from her company. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These would make it appear that Banks worked for her company. She complied and make the false pay stubs for him, which allowed Banks to apply for the loan. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Records show that while he was initially denied a loan</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit union eventually agreed to a loan of $3,000. Later, </span><b>Detroit Metropolitan Credit Union ended up suing Banks for allegedly stiffing them on the loan. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, he agreed to pay 90% of the total amount, which he did in full by 2013.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the four charges that Banks is facing, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette also charged Banks as a habitual offender. The reason for this is because Banks has a checkered history that includes a number of prior criminal convictions. </span><b>Before his election to office in 2012, Banks was convicted of eight other felonies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-check-fraud-law.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing bad checks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-cancelled-revoked-financial-transaction-device.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit card fraud.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If convicted, Banks is facing up to life in prison. Of course it is doubtful that he would get a license to practice law. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial crime convictions can make many aspects of daily life very difficult. Difficulty in taking out a loan is only the tip of the iceberg. </span><b>People with prior felony convictions on their record, specifically for financial crimes, can have a very hard time getting financed to buy a house or a car, and often won’t be able to get a good job</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
