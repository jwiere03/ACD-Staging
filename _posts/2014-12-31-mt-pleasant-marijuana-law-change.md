<h2>Approval of Marijuana ProposalÂ Won't Change Police Policy</h2>
Last month, Mt. Pleasant residents voted to change the city charter in regards to marijuana. The code of ordinances no longer applies to transfer or possession of marijuana under one ounce. That is, as long as it occurs on private property by individuals over age 21.<!--more-->

However, one local police officer said that the change won't alter their enforcement of state laws. The spokesperson, Jeff Browne, stated that police never searched for or targeted residents for marijuana possession. Instead, the approach has been to address the marijuana issue during investigations for other crimes. In other words, the goal for Mt. Pleasant police is not to target individuals for possession but rather to enforce state law when needed.

A marijuana activist, Brandon McQueen, who gathered signatures for the initiative, stated that many individuals believe the vote was symbolic in nature. He believes politicians have lagged behind public opinion on marijuana possession and the vote shows it. He also feels the next important step is for lawmakers to address this issue further; hoping for statewide legalization of marijuana in 2016.

The proposal passed with 2,705 votes. That was about 62% of the votes cast. Only 1,639 people voted no.

McQueen said he was not surprised by the margin. He pointed out it was similar to the percentage of local voters who passed the 2008 state initiative on medical marijuana.

Notably, McQueen owned a marijuana dispensary between 2010-2011. After a 2013 Michigan Supreme Court ruling on dispensaries, the place was shut down. Currently, he owns a martial arts school in the city. In addition, McQueen sits on the city school board and was re-elected last month.

Regardless of the type of impact, this is an issue that residents will continue to debate for some time to come.
