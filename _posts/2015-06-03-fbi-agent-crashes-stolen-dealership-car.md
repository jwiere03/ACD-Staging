<h2>Then Again, Maybe Not....</h2>
It is against the law to impersonate an officer of the law. So when the 17-year-old from Ann Arbor called the Cueter Chrysler dealership in Ypsilanti Township, asking that a 2015 Dodge Charger be dropped off at his location for a test drive, he hadn't broken the law... yet.<!--more-->

But when a representative from the dealership arrived with the specified vehicle, at the pre-agreed upon location? Well, that all changed. The 17-year-old, whose name has not been released pending arraignment, told the dealership employees that he was an FBI agent. To add credibility to his claim, was the gun he was openly carrying on his hip.

During the test drive, the minor stole the vehicle and fled all the way to Toledo, Ohio, where he was involved in an accident. When local authorities responded to the scene of the accident, the 17-year-old, who was unharmed in the crash, once again told officers that he was an FBI agent.

The Dodge Charger, which had been rendered inoperable in the crash, was impounded. The minor was arrested and will face charges in both Michigan and Ohio. His gun, as it turns out, was an Airsoft gun with the orange safety tip removed.

In Ohio he will face charges as a juvenile, whereas in Michigan he will face charges as an adult. This is because Michigan law states that the age at which a person can be held responsible in criminal matters is 17, while in Ohio the age is 18.

The 17-year-old will be arraigned in the Washtenaw County Court, where some of his charges may include impersonating an FBI agent, and larceny of a motor vehicle. Under Michigan law, larceny of a rented motor vehicle is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a possible fine of up to $15,000.00 or 3 times the value of the vehicle.

Under Michigan law, impersonating a "peace officer" is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a possible fine of up to $1,000. In the list of what qualifies under the law as a "peace officer" is included "a federal law enforcement officer". As of yet there is no information regarding the charges he is likely to face in Ohio.
