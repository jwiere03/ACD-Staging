<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Appling, the 24-year-old former Michigan State University basketball star has been arrested a second time on </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weapons related charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is, according to media sources, the second time that Appling has been arrested in the last few months on charges related to a carrying a concealed weapon in Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first arrest happened took place outside the Pantheon Club, a strip club in Dearborn, MI. Club security personnel allegedly saw Appling pull an AK-47 from the trunk of his vehicle. The incident was reported to police, who arrived at the club and approached Appling, seated in the driver's seat of a dark blue Dodge Challenger.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers searched the vehicle and found a handgun under the front seat, a loaded weapon in the trunk of the car, and also a small amount of what police suspect was marijuana. Appling was arrested and charged with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying a Concealed Weapon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a five-year felony; Possession of a Loaded Firearm in a Vehicle, which is a two-year high court misdemeanor (which is treated like a felony; and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possession of Marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a one-year misdemeanor.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days before Appling was due to appear in court for his preliminary hearing on that first criminal case, he was arrested again, this time for Carrying a Concealed Weapon. According to police records, the incident took place when officers on patrol stopped a Dodge Charger that was speeding. The vehicle belonged to Appling's brother. Although Appling was not the driver, an officer is said to have seen him place a weapon under the seat. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>He could be charged as a second habitual offender</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Appling was arrested again, but according to his attorney, he has not been formally charged in connection with this most recent incident. Under Michigan law, Carrying a Concealed Weapon is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, fines of up to $2,500 or both, along with possible forfeiture of the weapon involved. If Appling is convicted of a felony for the first offense, he could be charged as a second habitual offender in the second case. The would enhance his possible prison time in the second case. </span>
