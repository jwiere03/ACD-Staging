Walter White would be proud. And that isn't a compliment.

While Breaking Bad may have been a great show with a devoted following, the reality of methamphetamines is terrifying and far less glamorous. And here in Michigan, that couldn't be more true. Because like it or not, we are on the fast track to being the nation's new meth capital.<!--more-->

According to the State Police, the number of meth dump sites and labs has increased steadily every year for the last decade here in the mitten state. A data base of meth statistics from around the nation compiled by the Missouri State Highway Patrol has tracked the reported meth instances for every state in the US for the last eleven years. And Michigan's meth use is on the increase.

In 2012, Michigan had 591 methamphetamine  related incidents. In 2013 it had risen slightly, topping out at 607 incidents for the year. But in 2014 the number had risen to 750, and by March 26th of this year the number was already at 53 and climbing. According to police, April is the month when the numbers really start to rise because the snow melts, revealing months of hidden dump sites.

By this time last year, Indiana had taken the not-so-glamorous title of "nation's largest meth producing state.” But Michigan wasn't too far behind. In fact, the area around the midwestern states is by far the worst. By the end of last year only four states produced more meth than Michigan - Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, and Ohio.

<h2>Steps to help reduce meth production and usage</h2>

Michigan's rapidly growing production and consumption numbers point to the scary fact that, as a state, we are not far from the top of this awful ladder. So what can be done to combat this steadily growing problem?

Well, lots. Public awareness and education is a major factor. The State Police do about 500 educational presentations per year to help keep the public informed. And the law plays a role in prevention as well. <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine" target="_blank">Producing and distributing meth are felony charges in Michigan</a> that will land you in prison for years.

Currently Michigan is one of the 27 states using NPLEX, the real-time online tracking system which monitors all purchases of pharmaceutical cold and allergy medications used in the production of meth. Michigan's Legislature recently passed laws limiting the purchase of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, and the quantities a person may have at one time.

But the truth is that it’s going to take more than rules and regulations to stem the flow of meth around Michigan. After all, drug abuse is often a symptom of  greater social problem, and prison doesn't solve social problems. If you, or someone you love, gets caught up in meth we urge you to get help.  And if you need legal help, we stand ready to defend.  <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today.
