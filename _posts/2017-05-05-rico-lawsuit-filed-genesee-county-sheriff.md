&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In January of this year </span><b>a federal racketeering lawsuit was filed in the Detroit U.S. District Court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Michigan attorney Scott Batey. According to Batey, Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell has made it a habit to deputize people who he believes will advance his political career in the future. However, this accusation hasn't met with resounding support.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, Pickell is accused of deputizing people in return for payments ranging from $65 - $300 a year. Once deputized, </span><b>they were then able to act as deputies, agents, and process servers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/genesee-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genesee County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sheriff's Office in Flint, MI. The lawsuit names Pickell, Scott Hope and the Allen &amp; Hope Process Serving Management Company as defendants in the federal lawsuit.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes </span><b>no less than eight former process servers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Genesee County. William Trier, Jeffrey McKinsey, Harold Daniel, John Austin Harrington, Richard Sparks, Jacob Trier, Crystal Baker and Joel Mata are all individually named in the lawsuit. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit describes the way in which Pickell, Hope and Allen &amp; Hope Process Serving Management Company </span><b>operated as a "loosely knit business enterprise" aimed only at making more money</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and accuses the trio of working to keep Pickell in office by attacking anyone who spoke out against him.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegations that resulted in this lawsuit are that over the course of 10 years, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-check-fraud-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the required fees that Pickell receives in return for deputizing process servers, was put in "a bank account for (Pickell's) personal gain/benefit." Pickell, however, </span><b>claims he's never seen a penny</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these supposed secret funds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I didn't see that money, I don't even know where it went," Pickell said in an interview with MLive. "</span>I want to state clearly that this is a frivolous lawsuit that has no merit. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is more about the attorney getting his money than the truth."</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Anyone with $150 can file a lawsuit. I look forward to taking quick action."</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit in the Federal Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleges that the defendants are guilty of at least two counts of the federal </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-racketeering-attorneys-continuing-criminal-enterprise-rico-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racketeering Influenced And Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and one count of violating First Amendment Rights. </span><b>Both of these are series charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with penalties that involve at the worst, many years in prison, and minimum, a loss of his job and future ability to work as a law enforcement officer.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since filing the suit, attorneys for Scott Hope and his company have filed motions </span><b>requesting that the claimants submit a formal civil RICO case statement. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would explain the specifics behind the claims. Batey has since filed a response to this motion, but he says the request is completely unnecessary because the evidence speaks for itself.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal definition of racketeering is different from the one outlined by the state of Michigan. </span><b>The federal definition of the racketeering pattern refers to "acts" of racketeering activity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the Michigan definition refers to "incidents." This has led to some ambiguity about what the word incidents means exactly, and how it can be applied in a criminal case. Pickell however, is being sued in federal court, where the definition of RICO is very clear cut.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accusations of racketeering and criminal charges related to organized crime are </span><b>taken  seriously both by the state of Michigan and by the federal government.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you or a loved one have been accused of continuing a criminal enterprise or any other white collar crime, you will need a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly skilled criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your side.
