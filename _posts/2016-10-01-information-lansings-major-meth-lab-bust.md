<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Tuesday night, the </span><b><a href="http://www.lansingmi.gov/483/Tri-County-Metro-Narcotics" target="_blank">Tri-County Metro Narcotics Squad</a> coordinated a raid on two homes in Lansing suspected of being meth labs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Apparently the bust was the result of information officers had acquired while conducting an undercover operation. The meth lab was apparently one of the largest ever busted by police in the Lansing area.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The homes, located in the 1300 block of Washington Avenue and the 800 block of Loa Street, were both raided on Tuesday late afternoon. People living in the surrounding neighborhoods say that </span><b>the streets were full of police cars</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both Michigan State Police cruisers and unmarked vehicles.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to updates released by police, at the home on Washington Avenue which is where the raid began, officers </span><b>discovered a number of "one pot" meth labs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Included in the evidence was one active cooking one-pot lab, and remnants from a number of others. In addition, officers also discovered </span><b>4 small pop bottles and 15 two-liter bottles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that had been used to cook meth.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence found at the first house led officers to the home on Loa street, where investigators discovered </span><b>70 two-liter bottles and 15 smaller bottles that had been used for cooking meth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Officers did seize methamphetamines as well, but have not released any information regarding how much it was.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the evidence discovered at the two scenes, </span><b>officers also arrested two individuals </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>in connection with the meth bust</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They have not, however, released any information regarding the identity of the two people arrested, nor have they revealed the charges that they will be seeking against the individuals.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While using meth is a misdemeanor in Michigan, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">possession of meth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a </span><b>10 year felony that might also cost you $15,000 in fines</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As if that isn’t sobering enough, manufacture and distribution of meth are 20 year felonies with possible fines of up to $25,000.</span>
