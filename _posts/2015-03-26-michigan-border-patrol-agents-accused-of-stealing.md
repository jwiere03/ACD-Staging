"Confidence in public safety is of utmost importance," said Attorney General Bill Schuette in a recent press release, "As Attorney General, I have a responsibility to enforce the law and ensure public integrity. Taxpayers deserve honesty and accountability from those who work on their behalf."<!--more-->

Which is why Terence Mitchell Bruce of St. Clair Shores and Stanley Lyle Nicholson of Romulus, two border patrol agents, are in so much trouble.

According to a statement released by the Attorney General's Public Integrity Unit, the two agents are accused of stealing items while executing an agency-authorized search warrant at someone's home on December 23rd. The items in question were apparently taken for personal use.

<h2>Bruce and Nicholson are being charged with two felonies</h2>

Following an investigation by the Michigan State Police and the Public Integrity Unit, Bruce and Nicholson are being charged with two felonies. Both men are charged with a single count each of Misconduct in office. This is punishable by up to 5 years in prison and the possibility of a $10,000 fine. They are also each charged with Larceny in a Building. This felony is also punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a possible fine of $5,000.

According to the Attorney General's website, both men surrendered themselves for arrest. They were arraigned in the 12th District Court before Judge Joseph S. Filip. Their bonds were set at $25,000 and their next two court appearances were scheduled. The court dates are for a preliminary exam conference on March 27th and a preliminary hearing on April 8th.

The Public Integrity Unit, which investigated the allegations against Bruce and Nicholson, was created as part of the Attorney General's Office in January of 2011. It works to reduce corruption in the government and restore the public's trust in their government agencies.

Since it's inception, the Public Integrity Unit has filed a total of 313 charges against 64 individuals who hold positions of public trust. This includes both state and local government officials.
