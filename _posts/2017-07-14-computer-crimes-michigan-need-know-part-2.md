&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back, and thank you for joining The Kronzek Firm as we unpack the subject of computer crimes in Michigan. In the <a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/computer-crimes-michigan-need-know-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous article</a> we looked at exactly what a computer crime was, and </span><b>what types of criminal activity is usually categorized as "cyber crime"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moving on, we're going to be discussing the charges a person could face if convicted of a computer crime.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we talked about in the previous article , there are many different types of criminal activity that fall under the umbrella title of computer crimes. </span><b>In each case, there will be specific charges that stem from the specific crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, a person who is accused of circulating child porn is going to be charged with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-child-pornography-laws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distribution of Child Sexually Abusive Material</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Michigan, this is a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for other crimes like Soliciting a Minor, Revenge Porn, and Fraud. In each instance </span><b>there are specific charges that the defendant is likely to face</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that deal specifically with that crime. However in many cases, because a computer was used in committing the crime, the prosecutor will also slap on an additional charge of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-of-a-computer-to-commit-a-crime-in-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of a Computer to Commit a Crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, you can be charged with both the underlying crime, and the additional crime of using a computer to commit a crime. Â Surprisingly, there are numerous instances where the computer crime can carry </span><b>a potential prison term which exceeds that of the underlying criminal charge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This may seem impossible, until you consider the fact that the penalty for Using a Computer to Commit a Crime varies, based on the type and severity of the underlying crime.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>How computer crimes are charged in Michigan:</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if the underlying offense is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 1 year in jail, then the accused may be charged with another misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 1 year in jail, a fine of no more than $5,000.00, or both. </span><b>As the severity of the underlying crimes increases, the severity of the computer crime charge increases also</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the underlying offense is a 4 year felony, then the additional using a computer to committ a crime charge would be classified as a felony with a maximum penalty of 4 years in prison, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both. For an underlying offense that is a 10 year felony, the using a computer crimes would be classified as </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a felony with a maximum penalty of 7 years in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both. In cases where </span><b>the underlying crime is a felony punishable by up to life in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then the person may also be charged with Use of a Computer to Commit a Crime with a maximum penalty up to 20 years in prison, a fine up to $20,000.00, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the incredibly harsh prison sentences and high fines that a person can face when accused of using a computer to commit crimes, they may also lose valuable items to civil forfeiture. For example, </span><b>money and other financial assets, along with personal property like computers, peripherals, software, laptops and mobile devices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of these and more might be confiscated and forfeited by the police during the investigation.</span>
