<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Michelle McIntosh was recently arrested in Texas and then extradited back to Michigan to face Genessee County murder charges for the fatal shooting of Havana Wright. McIntosh was arraigned in the 68th District Court in Flint on the 1st of April, nearly a month after her arrest in Dallas. She has been charged with first degree murder.</span>


<h2>Fight between women resulted in deadly gunfire</h2>

It all began in late April of 2013, when a fight broke out between two women at the Palm Tree Club in Flint, MI. The fight spilled out into the parking lot and ended with deadly gunfire. When responding officers arrived, they found a the body of Havana Wright, shot in the chest. A security guard had also been shot, but wasn't fatally wounded. He has since recovered.

Police began searching for Michelle McIntosh. At first they claimed she was a person of interest in the murder, but soon after a warrant was issued for her arrest.

Almost a full year later, in mid March, McIntosh was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Dallas, Texas. She was pulled over in her car and was immediately surrounded by Dallas police officers and the U.S. Marshals North Texas Fugitive task force. Apparently McIntosh then put her car into reverse and backed into a police car, harming an officer. She then drove forward to clear an escape path. The chase did not last long, however, because McIntosh pulled over once more and surrendered herself. She was taken into custody and held at the Dallas County Jail until being extradited back to Michigan.
