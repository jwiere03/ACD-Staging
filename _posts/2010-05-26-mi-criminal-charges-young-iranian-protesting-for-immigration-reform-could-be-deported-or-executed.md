  citizenship to undocumented residents

Home is where the heart is, regardless of whether a person was born in that specific location or not. However, over the past few weeks, waves of anti-immigration legislation shows that not all Americans agree. Although many people come to the United States from all over the worldÂ  in search of a better life, the citizenship process is extensive and can take years to complete. If an applicant is rejected, they immediately become an illegal alien and are not legally permitted to live and work in America--even if the individual has lived here their entire life. An example alerted to Michigan criminal defense lawyers is that of a 24 year-old Iranian man facing deportation and execution after organizing a sit-in protesting anti-immigration legislation.

When Mohammad Abdollahi was only three years-old, he moved with his parents to the United States while his father worked for his PhD at the University of Michigan. It did not take long for the Abdollahi family to fall in love with Michigan, and decide to make it their permanent home. However, after receiving false information from their attorney, the family's citizenship applications were denied and the lost legal status.

Abdollahi, now 24 years-old, states that he never really noticed much of a difference between others and himself. "Playing in the playground with all the other kids, you're all the same. I was the same as everyone else," he explained. However, the reminder of his undocumented status became quickly apparent when he attempted to apply to college--even though he had sufficient grades and credentials, Abdollahi was rejected from Eastern Michigan University because he is an illegal immigrant.

<h2>Abdollahi spent years focusing on changing legislation</h2>

Discouraged, but not defeated, Abdollahi spent the following years focusing on changing legislation involving undocumented immigrants, specifically those who came to the United States as children and lived there for many years. In a recent effort, the activist led a protest in Senator John McCain's office protesting the implementation of anti-immigration legislation. According to the National Iranian American Council, the goal of the sit-in was to bring attention to the DREAM Act. (Development, Relief, and Education of Alien Minors Act). This legislation would allow conditional permanent citizenship to anyone who entered the country before 16 years-old, and lived in the United States for over five consecutive years. Then, after receiving a college degree or serving in the military, the immigrant would be able to apply for a green car and citizenship.

However, his participation in the peaceful protest, a protected right under the Constitution, has made him eligible for deportation, and possibly execution. As a homosexual, should he return to Iran, he would be killed as it is a crime punishable by death. Although some legislators have been less than sympathetic towards Abdollahi's cause, Iranian organizations continue to advocate on his behalf, maintaining that their case is unique. "The issue of legalization is different for the Iranian community than for other immigrant communities," Azadeh Ghafari, Coordinator of Outreach to the Middle East Community for Dreamactivist.org, explained to the NIAC. "Because Iranians cannot simply cross the border, most enter the country legally but many continue to live with the frustrations that come with lost immigration paper work, not having the funds to file the paper work, or simply falling out of status due to over-staying a visitor or student visa," Ghafari said.

When looking at cases like that of Mohammad Abdollahi's, it reminds us of the impact that legislation can make, both positive and negative. It is important to work with people, and not against them, to achieve progress. Otherwise, as seen in this case, law-abiding, long-time residents are put at a significant disadvantage, potentially throwing them in harm's way. For the best protection of your personal liberties, it is essential to contact aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">Michigan defense lawyers</a> immediately. Doing so can not only help your freedoms, but also ensure that everyone receives equality and justice in the eyes of the law, even undocumented aliens.
