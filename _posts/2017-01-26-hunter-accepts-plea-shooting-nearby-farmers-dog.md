&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler M. McKeon, a hunter in the Bay City area, is accused of shooting a neighbor's dog. He was scheduled to appear before Judge Joseph K. Sheeran for his trial a few days ago, however</span><b> he chose instead to skip the trial and accept a plea bargain</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. McKeon has entered a no contest plea to a single count of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-animal-cruelty-law-defense-lawyer-criminal-attorney.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempted Killing or Torturing an Animal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, this means that </span><b>McKeon has not admitted guilt to the charge, but has stated for the record that he will not contest the charge against him</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Michigan, </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(uabawjupnuy3lbunxjqhyobi))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-750-50b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempted Killing or Torturing an Animal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a felony punishable by up to two years in prison. In return for the plea, the prosecutor's office agreed to drop a single count of Killing or Torturing an Animal, which is punishable by up to four years in prison, fines of up to $5,000, and as many as 500 hours of community service.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, </span><b>McKeon is accused of is shooting Tippy, a neighbor's young Labrador/Pit Bull mix that he claimed was bothering him while he was hunting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on his father's land. Jeffrey Pickvet, Tippy's owner, says that he was working in his barn when he heard several gunshots and a dog yelp. He suspected that someone had shot one of his dogs and he went back to the house to tell his wife. Denise Pickvet says that after her husband told her about his suspicions, </span><b>she got into her truck and drove in the direction of the suspected gunshots.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Denise says she encountered McKeon walking along the side of the road and asked him if he had shot a dog. He said no, that all he had shot at were deer. But </span><b>Denise claims she suspected that he was lying, as he wouldn't make eye-contact with her.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She tried to block his departure with her truck, but claims that he drove around her and "flipped her off." She says she followed him and he eventually pulled over, where she confronted him again about </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shooting a dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and again he denied it.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Denise told the court that she copies down his license plate number while her husband called 911. A </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/msp/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trooper responded to the scene, and </span><b>accompanied Jeffrey Pickvet in the direction that he suspected the gunshots had originated.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> About 800 feet from the barn, near a hunting blind, they found Tippy's body.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the testimony provided by the Trooper on scene, Tippy's body was found in some weeds. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"It had obvious injuries, </span><b>large tears in its abdomen and holes in its appendages that appeared to be gunshot wounds.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It appeared the dog had been wounded approximately 10 feet or so from where it actually (died), based on blood it was leaving on foliage before it collapsed and died."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The MSP Trooper contacted McKeon by phone, and asked him about the situation. McKeon allegedly admitted that he had shot the dog, first with a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">muzzleloader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/illegal-discharge-of-a-firearm-in-michigan.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a handgun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He turned both guns over to the police as part of the investigation.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting fact to note is that, </span><b>under Michigan law an animal is defined as "any vertebrate other than a human being."</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This means that dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep and goats, rodents, snakes, and even birds are considered to be vertebrates. By definition, a vertebrate is any creature with a vertebrae, also called a backbone. There are currently about 64,000 species on earth classified as vertebrates. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimes that involve weaponry can be complicated. In addition to the possible penalties for the crime itself, </span><b>there is always the potential that your right to gun ownership could be jeopardized. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having your Michigan </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun rights restored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a complex undertaking, and requires the help of a highly skilled attorney.</span>
