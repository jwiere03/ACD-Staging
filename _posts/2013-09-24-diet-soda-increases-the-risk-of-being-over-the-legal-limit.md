The next time you are out on the town and thinking of enjoying a mixed drink, you just might want to think twice about using a diet soda in the mix. According to a study published earlier this year, cutting calories in your cocktail by adding diet soda can lead to a higher breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) than with regular soda.

Researchers conducted the study to see if the sugar content in drinks affects an individual’s BrAC—which is a measurement that police officers use to analyze levels of impairment and intoxication due to alcohol consumption.

Sixteen participants divided evenly between men and women attended three sessions where they were randomly given a same size drink made with vodka and Squirt, vodka and diet Squirt, or a placebo. Then the BrACs were recorded along with the participants’ impressions of their intoxication, impairment, fatigue, and desire to drive a vehicle afterward. They were also given a reaction time test which was then evaluated.


<h2>Sugar acts the same way as food in slowing the absorption of alcohol</h2>

Interestingly enough, the BrACs ended up testing a whopping 18% higher with the group that imbibed the alcohol and diet soda mixer. The mean peak was a .091 compared to a .077 with the regular soda and alcohol combo. This is because sugar slows down the absorption of alcohol from the stomach into the bloodstream, not that diet soda necessarily increases intoxication. The sugar acts the same way as food does in slowing the absorption of alcohol.

Furthermore, the task performance indicated that the greatest impairment occurred with the group that drank the alcohol with diet soda. However, the participants indicated that they felt no difference in their level of impairment regardless of which alcoholic drink type was consumed.

So a person might feel completely capable of getting behind the wheel when it really should be avoided. This may put individuals who tend to be weight conscious at a greater risk of getting charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Drunk-Driving.html" target="_blank">drunk driving</a>. So if you’ve had a cocktail or two containing a diet beverage, you may want to think twice and have a friend drive instead or take a taxi home. Or, if you cannot live without your Diet Coke, there are some personal breath alcohol testers on the market that could help you decide if you are able to safely drive.
