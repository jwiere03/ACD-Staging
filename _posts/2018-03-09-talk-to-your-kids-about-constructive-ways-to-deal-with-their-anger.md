&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a kid is hard these days. Children whose ages haven't even hit double digits yet, can be subjected to some very serious forms of bullying. In addition, there are modern challenges that children face these days, like </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-of-a-computer-to-commit-a-crime-in-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cyber bullying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that were never an issue for earlier generations. </span><b>Kids are coping with stress and anger at much earlier ages</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Without healthy coping skills in place, though, they sometimes make very bad choices! And this can lead to criminal charges. Nobody wants their kid to end up in Michigan’s juvenile justice court system, right?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Venting anger in certain ways can be seen as making threats!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Case in point, a 12-year-old boy from Warren, Michigan, was recently arrested and charged with Making a False Threat of Terrorism. Why? Because</span><b> another student found a "kill list" he had written, naming students and 'bad' teachers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were supposidly marked as targets. But did that boy really </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-intent-commit-murder-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intend to murder people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at his school? We may never know. He might simply be venting his rage at students and teachers who were repeatedly unkind to him, and whom he disliked strongly enough to want them gone from his life.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, we don't know if that boy is really a murderer-in-the-making, or just a very sad and angry child that been alienated, bullied and pushed around. </span><b>A child who doesn't have healthy coping skills in place for dealing with their negative emotions.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And he isn't the only one. An 18-year-old senior at Utica High School was arrested just days ago for making a video where he was shown with a gun, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/illegal-discharge-of-a-firearm-in-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatening to shoot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students at his high school. He posted the video on social media, and police here in Michigan were quickly alerted.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Angry children often lack appropriate outlets for their negative emotions</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Children rarely, if ever, understand the true nature of long term consequences. As we pointed out </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-minors-understand-rights-apparently-not-pt-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a few weeks ago in an article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the American Academy for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry reveals that juveniles are </span><b>simply not mature enough to understand the complexities and far-reaching consequences </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of their choices. Even when the facts have been clearly explained to them, many still struggle to grasp the full scope of possibilities that could result from a single choice. Keep in mind that these kids don’t fully mature until very late teens or sometimes even into their twenties. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask the average young teen whether or not an angry kid who made a kill list should face decades in prison, and they'll probably tell you no. Why? Because </span><b>"he probably didn't mean it" or "no one should go to prison for just making a list!" </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, regardless of their lack of understanding of the law, it's still the law here in Michigan. Making a "kill list" could be illegal under certain circumstances, even if it was made in jest. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threatening to harm or kill people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even if you don't intend to follow through, is still against the law. And many kids simply don't understand that fact.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Protect your children by keeping them informed</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk to your kids about the importance of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/hyta-sentencing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making smart choices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Discuss constructive outlets when they are struggling with anger. Help your kids address problems when they come up, so that </span><b>resentment and bitterness don't build to uncontrollable levels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Children who don't have positive outlets for their feelings, and don't have a 'safe space' where they can talk about their problems are more likely to make poorly-thought-out, impulsive decisions that may get them into trouble!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No parent wants their child to spend years behind bars for a single stupid choice, or one impulsive decision whose consequences they didn't think through properly.
