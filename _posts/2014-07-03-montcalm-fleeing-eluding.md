<h2>Detroit Man Strikes EMT</h2>
James Carl Leichtweis, a 54-year-old Detroit man, has been charged with fourth degree fleeing and eluding, and reckless driving. The charges are the result of an incident that occurred on June 25th in the Bethel Lutheran Church parking lot on West Howard City-Edmore Road in Reynolds Township. Leichtweis was found by a citizen, slumped over inside his car which was parked in the church parking lot.  911 was called and the dispatcher sent paramedics to the scene.<!--more-->

Emergency medical personnel arrived just before 5 pm and tried to speak to Leichtweis through the window of his car, checking his condition. But Leichtweis apparently sped away, striking a member of the paramedics team in the process. The EMT was not hurt.

Police were called, and a Montcalm sheriff's deputy began the search for Leichtweis' vehicle - a 1998 Chevrolet S-10 pickup. He was finally found on Almy Road near Amy School Road. The officer attempted to initiate a traffic stop, but Leichtweis fled the scene a second time.

The deputy pursued Leichtweis' vehicle in a high-speed chase through the back roads of Reynolds Township. Apparently the vehicles reached a top speed of 85 mph during the chase. The deputy was finally able to pull Leichtweis over near the on-ramp to northbound U.S. 131 at M-82.

Leichtweis was arrested and lodged in the Montcalm County Jail. He was arraigned on charges of fourth-degree fleeing and eluding and reckless driving, and held on a $1,000 bond.
