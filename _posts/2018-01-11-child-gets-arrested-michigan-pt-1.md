But you're not alone.[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a parent, there are few things more frustrating than getting a call from your child - at the local police station where </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they're under arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for doing something stupid. But regardless of how little you may want to get that call, for many parents it's a reality they can't avoid. </span><b>So what do you do? How do you handle it?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It's really scary - we get it! (We're parents too!) So let's take a look at this together, and talk about your options. We’re helped out with this very dilemma hundreds of times. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Let's start at the beginning…</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids are impulsive. They often </span><b>make choices without thinking them through.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They tend to believe they're not vulnerable, and that "bad things" only happen to other people. That can lead to some pretty dumb decisions, and some </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disastrous results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! So when your kid makes a thoughtless choice that lands them behind bars in a Michigan County Jail, there are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind:</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3><b> Stay Calm!</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize this is the equivalent of telling someone not to get mad when they discover their spouse </span><a href="https://www.midmichigandivorce.com/practice-areas/do-i-need-a-divorce-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheating on them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! In the moment it feels practically impossible. However, the reality is that yelling and </span><b>name-calling and accusations aren't going to help anyone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, people don't always make the best choices when they're wound up. So if you want to drive home the point about making well-thought-out-decisions to your child, losing your cool in the moment isn't the way to do it! Take a deep breath. We can do this together.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Get as much information as you can.</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get that phone call, get as much info as you can. Find out where your child is being held, what they were arrested for, </span><b>who they've spoken to since their arrest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and whether or not </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bail-bonds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bail is an option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remember, you can't do anything to help them until you know exactly what the problem is. So try to get as much information as possible as quickly as you can. Next, you should understand that the phone call might be recorded. That means that you should tell your child to not talk about what happened. Don’t go there. Say that you understand they are afraid and that you’ll work on getting an attorney and bailing them out. Then go from there…</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Don't "play attorney" or give your child legal advice!</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be the parent, which means that in most situations you know what's best for your child. But when it comes to the legal world, </span><b>a simple mistake can change the outcome of a case!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DO NOT encourage your child to confess anything, to "just be honest" with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or to share "their side of the story." The only advice you should be giving them is to respectfully keep their lips buttoned until the attorney you hire shows up. (Which should be ASAP!) So, shut up, lawyer up and call an experienced criminal defense lawyer quickly. Many of us answer our phones 24/7 for emergencies just like yours. </span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Hire an experienced attorney who handles criminal defenses</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sooner you get an attorney, the better! Being arrested is a terrifying experience and kids are so easy to manipulate, as they aren't</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> familiar with the system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Getting a frightened kid to admit to something, or to confess to a crime isn't hard when </span><b>the investigator is seasoned, and the kid is still wet-behind-the-ears</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the faster you get a skilled defense attorney in there, the better your child's chances of coming out unscathed will be! Keep your child quiet. </span>
