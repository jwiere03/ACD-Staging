<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for joining us again for the wrap up of this </span><b>three part series on probation and probation violations in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this is the first time you're joining us, we recommend that you take a few minutes to go back and look over the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-michigan-need-know-part-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-michigan-need-know-part-2.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> articles to get caught up. However, for those of you who've been with us from the start, let's dive right in where we left off…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What happens if you violate the conditions of your probation?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are suspected of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violating your probation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the court may take several different steps. If the violation was extremely minor, or a technicality, the court may choose to do nothing. If however, the violation was something more serious, </span><b>you will either receive a letter notifying you of a probation violation hearing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Michigan law states that you have a right to an arraignment and that you must be notified of the allegations against you. If you believe that the allegations of probation violation are incorrect, you have the right to a probation violation hearing. At this hearing, the prosecutor or probation agent has to prove with evidence that you violated a term of your probation. You have the right to be presumed innocent of that allegation.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are the consequences of probation violation?</b></h2>
If the court finds you guilty of violating the conditions of your probation in Michigan, there are a number of options available to them.

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could be issued a warning</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could be fined</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could have the conditions of your probation modified (to include additional meetings, counseling sessions or community service hours) or have more restrictions imposed on you (like a curfew or an electronic tether)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could have your probation period extended or required to spend some time in jail</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could have your probation revoked or modified, and instead be </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentenced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the underlying offense which means that you would go to jail or to prison.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Should you have a probation violation attorney?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely! There is too much at stake here to make the mistake of representing yourself in court. Almost as bad is hiring an attorney who has no experience in this area. At a violation or revocation or probation hearing here in Michigan, </span><b>finding a violation of your probation must be based on a “preponderance of the evidence” (which means it is more likely than not), rather than the stricter “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a criminal proceeding. Getting an attorney who has years of experience will make all the difference to your case, and can ensure that you get the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Proven-Results" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best possible results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your situation.</span>
