&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a widely known fact that the US puts more people behind bars, per capita, than any other nation on earth. As if that isn't scary enough, </span><b>Michigan has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, according to a report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Michigan is tied with six other states for the third highest parent </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incarceration rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Only Kentucky and Indiana have higher rates. But it seems our new "smart justice" approach may just be paying offâ€¦</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Senator John Proos recently shared some amazing news. A recent report apparently shows that Michigan's prison population has actually </span><b>dropped below 40,000 for the first time in over 20 years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Incredible, isn't it? As a state we're known for our </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tough-on-crime stance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to sentencing, and if there's one thing we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren't</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known for it's the merciful side of our justice system. Though this recent good news is a sign that things are changing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is fantastic news for our entire state and is an illustration that our efforts to focus our criminal justice system on </span><b>lowering recidivism and keeping Michigan safe</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are yielding positive results," said Senator Proos in a statement </span><a href="http://www.senatorjohnproos.com/proos-applauds-michigan-prison-population-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on his website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He went on to say that he congratulates Director Washington and the Michigan Department of Corrections for "doing a great job in preparing prisoners for life outside of prison, and my legislative colleagues for enacting smart reforms to help break the cycle of crime."</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Michigan's 'smart justice' reforms may be finally paying off!</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The smart reforms that Senator Proos was referring in his statement were a series of changes made to Michigan law in the last few years. They covered everything from shortening </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation terms for prisoners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with good behavior, to the Recidivism Reduction Act. By taking what Governor Snyder referred to as </span><b>a "smart justice" approach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state of Michigan hopes to save money, boost the economy and help the Michigan population by taking a new approach to sentencing and incarceration here in the Great Lakes State.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the numbers are an accurate reflection, then it's an approach that seems to be working. According to the most recent prison census for Michigan, </span><b>the total prison population is now 39,991</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is monumental. This is the first time in over 20 years that our prison population has dropped below 40,000 since 1994, when we reached that count and kept climbing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"The overwhelming majority of our prisoners will eventually return to their communities. Efficiently and effectively rehabilitating prisoners gives them </span><b>a better chance at normal and productive lives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it reduces crime, recidivism and costs." Proos says. He also points out that "Each time a parolee successfully re-enters society is one less </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crime being committed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one less victim and one less person costing taxpayers thousands of dollars to keep behind bars." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging as this is, however, Michigan still has a long way to go in addressing it's attitude to prisoners, and overall prisoner treatment.
