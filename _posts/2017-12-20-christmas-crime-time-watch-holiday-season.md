Time to deck the halls, trim the tree, and... watch out for drunk drivers?[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For some folks, the Christmas season means </span><b>decorating the tree, getting together with family, and exchanging gifts with loved ones</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or at least, that's what they hope it means. But reality is often nothing like our expectations. For some people, this holiday season will mean unplanned </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interactions with cops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for an unlucky few, perhaps even a pair of shiny new bracelets from their friendly neighborhood law enforcement officer.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we head into the holly-jolly season, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all over the state of Michigan say that there are increases in certain types of crimes. Christmas crimes, you say? Yes indeed, and we don't mean spiking the eggnog at the office party, or </span><b>wearing a really terrible sweater</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Although some of those sweaters really should be criminal!) We're talking about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crimes. The kind that earn you a day (or three) in court, and maybe even and long "vacation" in one of our infamous state-run correctional facilities.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Drunk Driving:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don't have to spike the eggnog to get tipsy at a Christmas gathering. Holiday get-togethers tend to mean more festivities, which often means more alcohol. The result? More people driving home afterwards </span><b>under the influence of certain Christmas spirits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Keep a close eye out for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drunk drivers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you're heading home. And if you choose to have a few drinks at your family get-together, be sure to designate a driver, call a car service or extend your stay until you sober up. It would be terrible to end up behind bars at Christmas time!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Package Theft:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With more and more people shopping online these days, a good deal of Christmas gifts don't come home from the store anymore. Instead, </span><b>they show up on people's door steps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, left there by the USPS or UPS drivers who delivered them. But for people who are gone at the office all day, there's no way to make sure that gift makes it safety inside until they arrive home after five oâ€™clock. As a result, package theft has spiked these last few years, and particularly at Christmas time! So keep an eye on your doorstep deliveries, and get items indoors as soon as you can. Better yet, have them shipped to a friend of family member that will be a home during the day to accept the delivery. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Domestic Assault:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting together with extended family might be wonderful, if you happen to have a family whose company you enjoy. But if your relatives include that one belligerent uncle who can't keep his mouth shut, the cousins who </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argue about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a mother-in-law for whom nothing is good enough, Christmas might be a little stressful. You're not alone! </span><b>Thousands of people dread their annual holiday-with-family-day</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Add a little alcohol or weed to the fire, and you have a guaranteed recipe for disaster! Instances of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domestic assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go up at Christmas time, so if you think you may end up in a fist-fight with someone this Christmas, perhaps it's time to change your yuletide festivities.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Burglary:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People here in Michigan buy a lot of nice stuff to give as gifts at Christmas time. But after all those gifts are exchanged, garbage cans and recycling bins all over, are exploding with tell-tale boxes and packaging. In essence, it's an advertisement for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anyone driving by</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see what lovely new goodies you have in your house. </span><b>PlayStation4 anyone? Perhaps a new flat screen TV, or a new laptop computer?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sounds great! Someone will be by at about 2 a.m. to sneak in and help themselves to the lot. The best way to avoid making your house a target? Dispose of your gift packaging discreetly. Break down and fold boxes inside out, and be sure that nothing is on display in your curb-side trash to announce your newest additions to the world! You can also take the boxes to a recycling center. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Do you need a lawyer at Christmas time?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The holidays are meant to be a time of good cheer and merriment, with everyone getting along and having a good time. But things don't always work out the way we hope they will. Sometimes situations get out of hand, or we make choices that don't work they way we'd planned. Either way, if you or a loved one ends up in trouble on or around Christmas, </span><b>call The Kronzek Firm at 866 766 5245</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">skilled criminal defense attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
