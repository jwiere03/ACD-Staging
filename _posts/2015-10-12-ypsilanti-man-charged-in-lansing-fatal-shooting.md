<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimario Deondrae Rowland-Taylor, a 24-year-old resident of Ypsilanti, has been charged with the death of 20-year-old Maurice Anthony-Charles Kirkwood, who was shot to death in southeast Lansing recently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to police, the shooting took place in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 3200 block of Trappers Cove Trail in the early hours of the morning on Friday, October 2nd. Apparently, several people became involved in a dispute, and the result was gunfire. According to Lansing Police Detectives, they believe that Rowland-Taylor fired from a vehicle at two people standing in the street.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police also say that the most recent dispute, which ended with gunfire, was actually about a previous dispute the three men had earlier. That one also apparently ended in gunfire. The two men shot were Kirkwood and another man, aged 20. Kirkwood, a resident of Haslett, later died of his wounds, but the second victim survived. He was treated at a local hospital and then released.</span>

Rowland-Taylor was captured by detectives from the Lansing Police Department, working together with MSU police, Michigan State Police and the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office. He was arraigned in the 55th District Court, before Magistrate Mark Blumer on numerous charges in the fatal shooting.


<h2>Prosecutor undecided on first or second degree murder charges</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, Rowland-Taylor has been charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank">open murder</a>, assault with intent to murder, and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felony firearm</a>. Open murder means that the prosecutor's office has not decided whether to charge the defendant with first or second degree murder. Rather, they will allow the jury to determine which charge is most appropriate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, first degree murder is punishable by life in prison, while second degree murder is punishable by any number of years, up to life. Assault with intent to murder is a felony punishable by any number of years up to life, while felony firearm is punishable by a four year mandatory sentence in prison.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for October 21st. Rowland-Taylor will appear before Ingham County Â District Court Judge Hugh Clarke Jr. in order for the court to determine if there is enough evidence for the defendant to be sent to trial.</span>
