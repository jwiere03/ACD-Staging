&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are, you're already aware of the fact that </span><b>taking a cop's gun</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is quite possibly the equivalent of signing your own death warrant. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/disarming-corrections-officer-michigan-gun-crime-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to disarm a police officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan is a hugely serious crime and will get you into a world of trouble, if not into a casket. But why? And what kind of repercussions are you looking at? Curious? Good. Let's take a look…</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, </span><b>taking a weapon from a corrections officer or peace officer is a felony</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the case whether </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the weapon in question is a gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or any other type of weapon. However, the type of weapon you just took from that cop will have an effect on the charges you're facing and the sentence you're liable to get. But first, let's clear up the issue of corrections and peace officers. Who are they anyway?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, </span><b>a corrections officer is a jail or prison guard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or any other employee of a jail, or a state or federal correctional facility. A peace officer, on the other hand, is a broader category. This includes: </span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A police officer of this state (Michigan), this includes both state police and local officers </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A police officer of the United States; </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sheriff or sheriff’s deputy of a Michigan county; </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A college or university public safety officer who is authorized to enforce state law and the ordinances and rules of that college or university; </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state conservation officer; </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A conservation officer of the United States department of interior.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take a weapon from an officer that isn't a firearm you are </span><b>facing a four year felony</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and possible fines of up to $2,500.00, or both. However, in order for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this charge to be brought</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of the following has to apply to the situation:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person taking the weapon knows (or has reason to know) that the person they've removed the weapon from is an officer.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The officer in question is acting in their professional capacity at the time.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weapon was taken without the consent of the officer.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The officer is authorized by to carry a weapon while on duty.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the weapon you take from an officer is a gun, you are facing up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000.00, or both. In order for this charge to be brought, a</span><b>ll of the same conditions  have to apply as with a weapon that isn't a gun</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, people who take weapons from officers often proceed to engage in other criminal activity. Usually this includes </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">running away from the police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using the weapon against another person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In some cases it </span><b>leads to the death of a civilian or an officer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In any case where there is more than one criminal charge brought, there is always the chance that the sentencing judge will choose to sentence you consecutively as opposed to concurrently. This means that after you've served one sentence, you will then have to serve another. Life is not good for a person convicted of disarming or attempting to disarm a cop. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please remember that taking an officer's weapon will always result in additional charges and a considerably more complicated case. We advise all of our readers to </span><b>keep their interactions with the police as polite and civil as possible.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Attacking an officer, insulting them, trying to fight with them, or even just running away from them is guaranteed to result in more charges against you, and also to make your defense more difficult. Obstructing, resisting or fighting with a police officer is always a horrible idea. </span>
