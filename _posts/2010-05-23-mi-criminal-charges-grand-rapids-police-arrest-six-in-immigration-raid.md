  Last week, six workers at a Grand Rapids
  business were arrested following a
  two-month investigation into potential
  immigration violations. Searches and
  raids such as these have been increasing
  in larger numbers following immigration
  bills passed across the country.
  Although well-intentioned, an increase
  in security can also inflict unnecessary
  searches on innocent people.

Around the country new pieces of legislation are being implemented directly targeting illegal aliens. As a result, many law enforcement task teams have been created to crack down on businesses that hire undocumented workers. Unfortunately, because security is increased, it is also likely that innocent people will be targeted by unfair investigations, circumstances seen often by experienced Michigan criminal defense attorneys. In fact, during a recent sting operation taking in place in Western Michigan, six workers were arrested on potential immigration violations.

For the past few months, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted five separate investigations, directly targeted at Western Michigan businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers. Federal agents finally had enough information to raid Clean Tech, a commercial office cleaning and floor maintenance business located in Grand Rapids, demanding employment records. In the end, six suspected illegal immigrants were arrested on administrative charges--one from Ecuador and five from Mexico.


<h2>Judge to decision if they will remain in the country</h2>

While the charges against them are administrative and not criminal, the consequences against the accused undocumented workers can be severe, including expulsion from the United States. According to ICE agent Khaalid Walls, the fate of these suspected illegal immigrants will be decided in an immigration courtroom. "A judge will make a decision on whether they will remain in the country or not," Walls explained.

The Michigan criminal defense lawyers for Clean Tech maintain that their clients are cooperating as much as possible with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "If there is any issues regarding anyone who's illegal they will be placed on administrative leave pending our own company's investigation," Clean Tech's lawyer commented. However, it was not acknowledged whether the president and owner of Clean Tech, Oswaldo Garces knew the background of his workers prior to hiring them. Additionally, as his whereabouts are currently unknown, ICE agents are searching for him with a warrant for Garces' arrest.

Even though investigations such as these sparked by recently passed immigration bills are well-intentioned, it is also possible to target innocent people unlawfully. Being convicted of violating immigration regulations will have severe consequences and almost certainly result in expulsion from the United States. Therefore, if taken into custody on such charges it is essential to be proactive in securing the best defense possible for your case.
