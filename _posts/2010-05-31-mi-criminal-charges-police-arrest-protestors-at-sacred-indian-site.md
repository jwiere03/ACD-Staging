Although the First Amendment provides Americans the freedom to free speech and peaceful protest, it is still possible to be arrested for criminal charges while acting within ones Constitutional rights. Unfortunately, such an occurrence can result in significant consequences, such as fines or potential jail time. A recent case that came to the attention of Michigan criminal defense attorneys serves as a perfect example, as six people were arrested after protesting the construction of a sacred Indian site located in Marquette County.

Last week, law enforcement officials took into custody six individuals, including two Native Americans, on Michigan trespassing charges at the planned site of Kennecott's nickel and copper mine. Construction of the mine will involve destroying Eagle Rock, a sacred site for the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community. In response, numerous trial members have camped out at the site for a number of weeks, protesting the destruction of cultural lands.

Even though the significance of Eagle Rock to the natives is widely known, advocates for the cause state that law enforcement officials have ignored their pleas for help. "The state of Michigan and Kennecott have ignored that premise," stated Chynthia Pryor of the Yellow Dog Watershed Preserve. "It was their right to protect Eagle Rock. And it's unfortunate that Kennecott did not use, I think, negotiating terms with the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community in determining good access to the site without people having to be arrested."


<h2>We fully understand the point of view they are coming from</h2>

Although a spokesperson for Kennecott explained that the protestors were arrested for safety reasons, they also acknowledged the merit behind their fight. "The right to protest and civil disobedience is a well respected right in the U.S. And we fully understand the point of view they are coming from," commented spokeswoman Deb Muchmore. However, allowing the campers to continue to stay outside the now-fenced construction site may directly attack the heart of their protest.

Being arrested for any criminal charges is a difficult experience for anyone to go through, let alone when a person is acting within the scope of their legal rights. Native persons have claims on their lands and should be worked with, not against, to achieve the best possible solution. If taken into custody however, the consequences can be life-changing and result in jail time. For the best protection of your personal freedoms and liberties, it is essential to be proactive in securing the best defense for your case.
