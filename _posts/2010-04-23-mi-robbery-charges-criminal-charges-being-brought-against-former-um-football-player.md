Practicing near big university campuses, aggressive Michigan criminal defense lawyers are likely to represent several collegiate athletes who suspected of criminal charges. Being accused of any violation, including robbery or larceny, is enough not only to enforce legal consequences on the student, it is possible they could be kicked off their athletic team or out of school entirely. Across the state, a recent example of this is seen through the case of a former University of Michigan football player, suspected of attempting to steal a taxi driver and two food delivery men on campus.

Former football player and student Boubacar Cissoko, 20, heard the charges against him earlier this week in a Washtenaw CountyÂ  Jail awaiting trial. He is being accused of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan assault charges</a> with intent of robbery, as well as two counts of larceny from a person. According to Ann Arbor police, Cissoko held up a cab driver as he dropped the football player off after leaving the bar. Allegedly, he pointed a pellet gun at the driver and demanded money from him. Even though it was not a real firearm, it looked like an actual handgun. When the driver refused to give him cash, Cissoko supposedly jumped out of the car and fled. About five minutes later, law enforcement officials found and arrested him, taking him to the police headquarters for questioning.

<h2>Cissoko allegedly stole money from another delivery man</h2>

After investigating the matter more deeply, detectives were able to link Cissoko to two on-campus thefts occurring last month. On March 13, police maintain that the football player took money from the hand of a Mr. Spots delivery man as he dropped off food on Mary Court. Less than 90 minutes later, Cissoko allegedly stole money from another delivery man in the same area. Law enforcement officials contend that he would often have the food delivered to his home and then ask for change for a large bill. Drivers, clearly not having change for such a big amount, would go back to their business to retrieve change. When they returned, Cissoko would pretend he was about to pay, then steal the money from the delivery man and run.

In less than a year, this is Cissoko's third time being arrested on criminal charges. Although it was dismissed later, he was arrested last June in Detroit for disorderly conduct. Additionally, he was taken into custody by police in January for marijuana possession charges, with an intent to distribute. Regardless how many violations he accumulates, coach Rich Rodriguez clearly believed one was too many--the coaching staff kicked off the football team in October after breaking team rules multiple times. Currently, Cissoko is awaiting his April 28th trial in custody, on $70,000 bond.

Being accused of a criminal charge is an overwhelming experience for any student to go through. Conviction of robbery and larceny will have serious consequences for anyone, regardless if the person is a collegiate athlete or not. Not only will it ruin your reputation, but it can significantly compromise your personal freedoms and liberties.
