<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Criminal Justice Overhaul" have been buzzwords around Michigan in the last few years. Michigan Governor Snyder has been saying that he wants to focus on changes that embody "</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-criminal-justice-reform-in-2016.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" here in the Great Lakes State. Now we have Senate bills proposing major changes to our criminal laws. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk is Cheap</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While our criminal defense attorneys here at the Kronzek firm are hugely in favor of changes that would make Michigan's criminal justice system more people-centered and outcome-oriented, we were reluctant to hold our collective breath. After all, few things operate at a more glacial pace than legislature. But it seems that there has finally been some positive action on the heels of all that chatter.</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.senate.michigan.gov/default.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has recently passed a landmark 20 bill package that addresses a wide array of criminal justice issues. Designed to keep prisoners from reoffending by providing greater opportunities for parolees once they are released, the bills aim to save taxpayers money.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping people incarcerated costs money. A lot of money. The programs we have in place right now in Michigan aren't doing much to help people create lives for themselves once they have served their sentences and are released. After all, getting a job is very hard for a convicted felon. Not being able to earn a decent living can in turn lead to homelessness, substance abuse issues, and ultimately returning to criminal activity. Most taxpayers in our state are primarily concerned with the expenses of the repeat offenders. That includes putting them back in prison, clogging up our criminal courts, paying probation and parole agents, monitoring them and tracking them. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These new bills would reduce parole and probation revocations, redefine recidivism, and create </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/u-s-justice-action-network-works-toward-sweeping-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supportive programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those who are recently released from prison. The bills also propose offering incentives to businesses and companies that hire parolees, making it a win-win situation for everyone involved. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills received unanimous, bipartisan support after State Senator John Proos, a key backer of the bills, spoke in favor of what these changes could offer Michigan residents. "Fifty percent of those in our prison system today are, in fact, individuals who have been under supervision, and have failed on probation or parole." he told the Senate during his speech.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Proos, the package would help those who are incarcerated by properly supporting their reentry into society. But, he pointed out, it would also help everyone else by saving Michigan residents money in the form of taxes spent on the state's prison system. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our criminal defense attorneys remind readers that this is only the first step in a long process. The bills are now headed for the House, where they will be voted on again before coming back to the Senate for a revote and finally heading to the Governor's desk.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By focusing on rehabilitation instead of reincarceration, we can offer future generations a chance at a brighter future. More people will have opportunities to make lives for themselves in the wake of mistakes. More children will have their parents present during their upbringing. More Michigan families will have the chance to stay together and work through challenges in positive and proactive ways. Taxpayers will spend less money on those that re-offend or better yet, those that donâ€™t re-offend because of a revamped system. What more could we ask for?</span>
