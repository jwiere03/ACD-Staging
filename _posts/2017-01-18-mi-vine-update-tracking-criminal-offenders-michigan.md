<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've never heard of MI-VINE, don't worry - you're not alone. Most of us here in Michigan Â have no idea what it is and how it could impact us in the future. With that in mind, we would like to take this opportunity to explain exactly what MI-VINE is, and why </span><b>recent updates and changes have made it even easier for someone to track people in the criminal justice system in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">MI_VINE stands for Michigan Victim Information and Notification Everyday. It is a 24/7 notification system for victims of crimes and concerned citizens. It can be used to stay up to date on the status of offenders in the criminal justice system. </span><b>It was created in 1994 in response to the death of Mary Byron. She was tragically murdered by her former boyfriend</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After Mary's boyfriend was </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incarcerated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she and her family were assured that they would be notified when he was released. They weren't notified, and so Mary had no chance to prepare before he attacked and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murdered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her after his release.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can tell from the name, MI-VINE is the Michigan extension of </span><a href="https://www.vinelink.com/#/home" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VINE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is the nationwide database that communicates with jail and prison booking systems in near real-time. </span><b>VINE provides members of the public with information about the status of offenders and allows them to see if there has been any chance to that status.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Examples of changes include release, escape or transfer. In addition, registered user can set up alerts, so that in the event of a inmate's release or an escape, they can be immediately notified</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until recently, when someone registered on MI_VINE while an offender was in county jail (awaiting </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or transfer to prison) that registration was only applicable to county jails. </span><b>Once the offender was moved to prison, the victim would have to register again in order to receive notifications</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,4551,7-119-1409---,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state prison system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In many cases, victims did not know that they were required to reregister, and so they would not receive any future notifications about the offender they were keeping tabs on.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent update to the system has changed all of that. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Department of Health and Human Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DHHS) has updated MI_VINE to include a new feature which eliminates that extra step. </span><b>RegistrationLink 2.0 now allows victims and concerned citizens in Michigan to better track someone as they move through the criminal justice system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by linking their cases with their records. This ensures that registrants do not lose track of someone as they move from jail to prison to freedom.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Lyon, the director of the Michigan DHHS, says that RegisrationLink forms an additional layer of security for Michigan residents and victims of crime. "</span><b>Crime victims deserve a seamless process to track an offende</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">r that has been transferred to another correctional facility and the right to know if the offender is due for parole."</span>
