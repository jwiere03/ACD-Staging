Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has announced his plan to help “reinvent public safety in Michigan.” Highlights of that plan include the addition of approximately 200 Michigan State Troopers to the force and approximately 20 state crime lab forensic scientists. The plan asks for more money to be available for the creation of special treatment courts, such as mental health courts or drug treatment courts. Finally, Snyder acknowledges the need to address human trafficking in Michigan and the truancy rate of Michigan’s youth.

The plan calls for the large majority of these resources to be sent to Detroit, Flint, Saginaw, and Pontiac, in an effort to clean up Michigan’s cities with the most crime (in fact, these cities are at the top of <em>national crime rates</em>). This has already received criticism from residents around the rest of the state, who want more public safety services available to them locally. Snyder argues that if those cities—and the travel routes between them—are safer, then the rest of the state will start to see a change, too. “This is about all Michiganders. By focusing on these four communities, this has an impact on crime no matter where you live,” Snyder said.

As criminal defense attorneys, we know about these issues in Detroit, Flint, Saginaw, and Pontiac first hand. We know that courts in those places do see a lot of criminal defendants (and defense attorneys) walk through the doors. However, we understand why people who live elsewhere in Michigan are claiming that this initiative is not a fair use of tax dollars.


<h2>Your defense lawyer will immediately begin work on your case</h2>

One thing we know for sure is that when there are more law enforcement officers available to investigate and solve crime, there are more criminal charges handed out. Any time a person feels the police are investigating them for a crime, that is the time to call a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Trial-Attorneys.html">skilled attorney</a>. Your defense lawyer will immediately begin work on your case, starting with gathering important information. Then, he or she will carefully craft a defense strategy that we agree is in your best interests. Don’t wait to call us.
