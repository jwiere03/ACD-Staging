<h2 dir="ltr">2 Men In St. Joseph County, MI  Facing Meth, Gun and Possession of Wild Deere Charges</h2>
In the recent St. Joseph County Meth arrest, Michigan law enforcement narcotics officers from southwest Michigan found an interesting combination of criminal activity.

While the melting snow usually heralds warmer weather and the return of spring, in St Joseph county, MI it recently revealed a few additional things for local police officers. A meth dump site was exposed and officers received a tip than meth was being produced in a nearby home on Brick Chapel Road in Constantine Township. Narcotics Officers obtained a warrant to enter and search the premises.

Investigation of the home yielded some surprising results. In addition to the discovery of several 'one-pot' meth labs and a variety of firearms, officers also found a captive deer. The DNR permits ownership of wild animals only when they were bred and raised in captivity. Animals taken from the wild may not be held in captivity, with the exception of legally licensed wildlife rehabilitators who may care for injured or orphaned wild animals.

The 2 men who lived at the address were arrested on charges of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html">felony firearm possession,</a> operating or maintaining a methamphetamine lab, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html">maintaining a drug house</a> and also possession of an illegally held wild animal. Their names have not been released to the public, pending arraignment.

Penalties for the illegal possession of a deer can include fines, jail time, restitution fees and loss of a hunting licence for several consecutive years. The term “felony firearm possession” can refer to several different charges, but according to the law it is a crime to possess a gun while committing any felony. So the sheer act of possessing a firearm while committing another felony such as producing meth, comes with a mandatory two year consecutive prison sentence.

While conservation violation charges are a misdemeanor, serious gun and drug charges are felonies. If you have been arrested and are facing gun charges or drug charges you may be penalised with substantial fines and extensive jail or prison time. Be certain to obtain the help of an experienced attorney who will provide you with the best possible defense.
