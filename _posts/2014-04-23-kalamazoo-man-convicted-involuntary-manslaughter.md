<h2>Tragic Death of Infant Son Results In More Than 5 Years In Prison</h2>
On April 18, 2014, a Kalamazoo man was convicted of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-manslaughter-attorneys.html">involuntary manslaughter</a> for the death of his 4-month-old son. He has been sentenced to more than 5 years in prison.  Judge Pamela Lightvoet called the sentence "one of the most difficult" that she had ever given.

The death of any infant is tragic, whether accidental, natural or intended. In this case, lack of information and inconclusive evidence made the judge's sentencing decision all the more difficult.

On November 19, 2013, police and firefighters responded to a report of a baby not breathing. Shortly after 1 am the baby was taken from an apartment on North Arlington Street in Kalamazoo Township to Bronson Methodist Hospital. He was later pronounced dead.  The authorities considered the death suspicious.

A few days later the infant's father, Tahj Oneal Lockett, 22, was arrested and charged with first-degree child abuse.  At that time the medical examiner's office did not provide any opinion on the cause of the baby's death, pending additional investigation and testing. However, Kalamazoo County Chief Assistant Prosecutor stated that additional charges could be added later.

On March 17, 2014, Lockett pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. As part of the plea agreement, one count of second-degree child abuse was dismissed. The prosecutors also agreed not to make a sentencing recommendation.

Lockett was initially scheduled for sentencing on April 14, 2014. The judge adjourned the sentencing in order to review trial transcripts, DHS information and files from mental competency evaluations. Court records from November show that Lockett was initially found incompetent to stand trial. After receiving treatment, he was later found competent.

Lockett was given credit for the 515 days he has already served in jail, and was ordered to pay more than $1,500 in restitution fees, plus court costs and attorney fees.

Involuntary manslaughter is, by definition, "Causing another person's death through reckless behavior, or while committing another crime but without the intent to kill". This felony charge carries a lighter sentence than most other forms of homicide because the death is said to have been unintended.
