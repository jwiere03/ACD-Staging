&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again for this discussion on false confessions, and how easy it is to get someone to admit to a crime they didn't commit. </span><b>Having already discussed a study in which psychologists were able to get college students to admit to crimes they weren't guilty of</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a controlled interview during the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-confessions-lie-isnt-actually-lie-part-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first installment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are going to move on to how these techniques are used by law enforcement.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>As explained by Dr. Julia Shaw and Dr. Stephen Porter in their study, memory can be manipulated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once a person believes something to be true, their imagination begins the process of filling in the details and creating the surrounding recollections to support that belief. The techniques are somewhat specialized, but once </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interrogator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is familiar with them, it isn't hard to get people to believe that they are guilty of something they never did. This happens here in Michigan with startling frequency! These false confessions have occurred in recent years in Kent County, Oakland County, Ingham County, Macomb County and lots of others including Ann Arbor. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innocence Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>police officers sometimes use these techniques in their interrogations, which is why we have such a high rate of false confession</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prosecutors around Michigan disagree though, claiming that cops don't benefit from incarcerating innocent people and that false confessions happen far less frequently that we think. The statistics however, say otherwise.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the previous article we suggested that you google the Reid Technique of interviewing, which is a three phase process designed to elicit a confession from a suspect. </span><b>Using the Reid technique, an investigator would tell the suspect that the results of the investigation clearly show that he/she committed the crime in question.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The investigator presents the scenario as a form of story in which they already know the outcome, all they need is the suspect's agreement. It is not a question and answer format, as one would expect.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important aspect of the process is the demeanor of the investigator during the interrogation. </span><b>They present themselves as understanding, patient, and even respectful</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The goal is to slowly make the suspect more comfortable with telling the 'truth'. Another aspect of the process involves the investigator offering the suspect various justifications for why they would have committed the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as if it were a perfectly </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/defenses-to-crimes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reasonable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and understandable course of action. The person being interrogated gains a false sense of security and ends up giving a false confession. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While this probably sounds very familiar (because it's the feature style of interview used by every TV cop since 21 Jump Street was popular!) it isn't acceptable. In 2012, a Canadian judge ruled that "stripped to its bare essentials, the Reid technique is a guilt-presumptive, confrontational, psychologically manipulative procedure whose purpose is to extract a confession." This opinion reflects </span><b>many people's belief that the Reid technique is abusive and dishonest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and runs a high risk of resulting in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">false confessions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, several law enforcement agencies in other parts of the world have begun to employ alternative methods for interviewing suspects. In Britain the PEACE method is used (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure and Evaluate), while in Canada </span><b>the Royal Mounted Police have developed a new method they describe as "less Kojak and more Dr. Phil."</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While it's encouraging to see that there is progress away from coercive and abusive interviewing techniques, we here in the US still have a long way to go! Michigan judges take note. </span>

&nbsp;
