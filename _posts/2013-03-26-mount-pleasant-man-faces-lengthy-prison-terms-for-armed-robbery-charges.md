A Mount Pleasant man faces numerous charges, including armed robbery, in connection with a slew of break-ins in Isabella County. Vincent Miguel Belmarez, 23, is accused of four robberies over three days, from February 16th to the 18th, with a fifth incident possibly linked to Belmarez and currently under investigation by Michigan State Police. If convicted of the more than a dozen charges handed to him Belmarez will face the possibility of up to life in prison. Police say Belmarez robbed at gunpoint two Payday Advance stores, a fast food restaurant, and a gas stationâ€™s food shop. The fifth incident, in Union Township, was also at a gas station. One of the robberies took place very near the Central Michigan University campus, and reports indicated that at one point local schools went into lockdown when news circulated of an armed gunman in the area.

<h2>Belmarez also accused of list of other felonies</h2>

In addition to armed robbery charges, Belmarez is accused of felon in possession of a firearm, assault with a dangerous weapon, and felony firearm.  A felony firearm charge carries a mandatory two year prison sentence which runs consecutive to any other sentence for the other counts. Police say that victims were able to identify Belmarez from a lineup. Belmarez is reportedly being held in Isabella County jail on nearly a million dollars bond, but that number may actually increase as he is arraigned on other charges.

Belmarez will need the assistance of a highly qualified Isabella County Criminal Defense Lawyer.  The Kronzek Firm PLC attorneys practice criminal defense throughout Michigan.
