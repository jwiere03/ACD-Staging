&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new 'right to carry' bill has been introduced in the Michigan House. If passed, the law would allow </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law-abiding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Michigan citizens to </span><b>carry concealed pistols without having to get a 'concealed pistol' license (CPL).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Under current Michigan law, a person who has a (CPL) gun license may carry their weapon on their person concealed from plain view of others. Certain areas are excepted from permissible areas to carry weapons. These include schools, bars, houses of worship and other places that are listed in the statute. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the simple act of </span><b>putting on a coat that obscures the gun holster on a person's hip</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would immediately put them in violation of the law if they don't also have a '</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concealed carry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">' permit. This law would change that.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><b>Responsible people shouldn’t have to obtain a special permit from the government to exercise a right that is guaranteed in both the U.S. and state constitutions.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” says State Representative Michele Hoitenga. He is one of the four state reps sponsoring the four-bill package. Joining her are Representatives Triston Cole of Mancelona, Sue Allor of Wolverine and Pamela Hornberger of Chesterfield Township.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Other states have recently passed full constitutional carry laws, and I plead to my colleagues and our governor to pass this commonsense package that will </span><b>allow law abiding women, like myself, to protect ourselves and our families without jumping through bureaucratic hoops</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." Hoitenga went on. "Criminals don’t complete the permitting process before they </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commit a crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s time we level the playing field for lawful people who want nothing more than to protect their families."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to the fact that the act of putting on a coat, which is hardly optional in a Michigan winter, makes a law-abiding citizen into a law-breaker, Representative Allor calls it 'nonsense'. She goes on to explain that </span><b>a responsible gun owner shouldn't have to apply for a special permit just to wear a jacket</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when outside exploring or hiking in nature.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Legal gun owners shouldn't need a separate permit in order to conceal their weapons. The right to carry should be enough, House Reps say.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you wondering how this would change the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current permitting structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan, the answer is "not much." According to Representative Hornberger, </span><b>the state would continue to issue concealed carry permits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however this legislation would eliminate the need to obtain a state-issued license to carry. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a permit owner who travels, don't worry - they've thought of that too. The current permitting structure won't change, which means that </span><b>Michigan CPL holders will be able to carry in other states</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that recognize a Michigan gun permit.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to representatives who sponsored the bill-package, which was developed with assistance from the recently formed Second Amendment Caucus, the goal is to reforming Michigan firearm laws. In the words of Representative Hornberger, "</span><b>People deserve to have the rights our Founding Fathers laid out for us in the U.S. Constitution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially the right to bear arms. The fees required by the current law amount to a tax that infringes on this fundamental right."</span>
