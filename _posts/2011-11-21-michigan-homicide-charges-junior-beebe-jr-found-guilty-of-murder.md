Justin Beebe Jr. was found guilty this summer by a jury in Van Buren County, Michigan in the <a title="Michigan Homicide Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html">murder</a> of Tonya Howarth and Amy Henslee. Beebe was accused of killing both women on January 24, 2011. The bodies of the women were found in a shallow grave approximately two feet from Beebe’s trailer. Each of them died as a result of two bullet wounds.

Beebe claimed that Howarth—his long-time girlfriend—came to his trailer and saw him with Henslee, the wife of Beebe’s cousin. According to Beebe, Howarth then shot and killed Henslee in a jealous rage, and that after a struggle, Beebe got the gun and shot Howarth in self-defense. The Van Buren County prosecutors painted a different picture, claiming that he murdered each of them in cold blood. The jury found Beebe guilty of first-degree premeditated murder against Howarth and second-degree murder against Henslee. Beebe will now require the assistance of a highly trained criminal appeal attorney.

<h2>The stakes are incredibly high</h2>

This case demonstrates the severe consequences that can occur when a person is accused of murder in Michigan. As any good <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/">criminal defense attorney</a> knows, first-degree murder in Michigan carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Clearly, the stakes are incredibly high, as this is the most serious crime in Michigan. Those who are being investigated for any type of homicide crime must hire an attorney who is very highly-skilled at defending such a severe accusation.

A claim of self-defense can be a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled trial attorney. When properly asserted by the defense, the burden shifts to the prosecution to prove that the actions of the defendant were not taken in a lawful defense of himself or others. The facts of this case are interesting because they involve a claim of actual innocence on one charge and self-defense on another. In the right circumstances, self-defense can be a total defense to an assaultive crime.
