For teens, taking a joy ride in a new is a dangerous, yet exhilarating experience. Usually, the vehicle used is belongs to a parent, relative, or friend, and is generally considered nothing more than a harmless prank. However, experienced Michigan criminal defense attorneys can attest that even seemingly harmless incidents can land the jokesters in serious trouble, especially if the vehicle in question is city-owned. These are the circumstances of a recent case involving two teens arrested in Macomb County after taking a school bus for illegally taking a school bus for a joy ride.

According to the Macomb County Sheriff's Office, a bus driver with Whiteford Agricultural Schools left the keys in the ignition when she parked the vehicle in her home driveway, located directly across the street from a local elementary school. This is generally done so that maintenance personnel can pick them up or other drivers may use the bus to transport students to various locations as needed. Later that evening however, she noticed that the school bus was missing and immediately reported it to law enforcement officials. While the investigator was interviewing the driver and her husband, the bus reportedly drove past her home.


<h2>Teenagers could face fines and possibly jail time</h2>

After a chase throughout Whiteford Township, police arrested the joy riders approximately 45 minutes after the bus was taken. The suspects, two Midwest teenagers were arrested on <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/motor-vehicle-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan motor vehicle charges </a>for unlawfully driving a vehicle and resisting arrest.

If convicted, the two teenagers could face many consequences including fines, probation, loss of driving privileges, or even jail time.
