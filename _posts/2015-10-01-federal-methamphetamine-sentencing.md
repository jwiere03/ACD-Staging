<h2><b>Man sentenced for "Breaking Bad" style meth RV</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fred A. Burlingame, the self-styled 'Walter White' of Bay County, has been sentenced to spend 15 years in a federal prison for manufacturing and selling "meth-on-the-move" from his RV.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He was </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/state-charges-dismissed-federal-charges-filed.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in December, when </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">police were investigating a claim of a stolen truck. Courtesy of a tip, the investigation led them to Burlingame. Police entered the apartment, belonging to his girlfriend, and discovered him in the act of drying methamphetamine in a microwave. Also discovered in Burlingame's apartment was a book bag containing numerous meth lab components. Law enforcement says that he was arrested without a fight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to police records, Burlingame's RV was in the parking lot of the apartment where he was arrested. Inside the RV police discovered components of a meth lab, along with a 20 gauge shotgun, some ammunition and two pipe bombs. Witness testimony was that Burlingame, his girlfriend, and sometimes the girlfriend's underaged daughter would sometimes live and travel around in the RV.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Court records show that between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 20, 2010, and Sept. 13, 2014, Burlingame purchased the nasal decongestant </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-the-nations-new-meth-capital.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pseudoephedrine hydrochloride</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 33 separate occasions. This is a key ingredient in the making of methamphetamine. Such purchases are closely tracked by the state.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, in addition to the gun, bombs and methamphetamine issues that Burlingame is facing with regard to the RV, the vehicle itself is a source of trouble. The Tiffin Allegro hadn't been licensed since 2005. It was also uninsured and had improper license plates. Additionally, Burlingame wasn't authorized to drive it, as he had a suspended license.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Burlingame pled guilty to single counts of manufacture and attempted manufacture of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Michigan-Methamphetamine-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers-drug-crime-Muskegon-county-MI" target="_blank">methamphetamine</a>. As per the agreement, the prosecution dropped a single count of unlawful transport of firearms, and another of possession of unregistered firearms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Burlingame was sentenced to 15 years behind bars, with three years of supervision after his release from federal prison. The Judge also ordered him to pay $100 in court fees and fines.</span>
