&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the average person thinks about "organized crime", they usually fall back on </span><b>the Hollywood stereotype, a/k/a The Sopranos</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This frequently includes an overweight man in his fifties, smoking and sweating in his poorly lit office, explaining in a heavy Italian accent that it would be a shame if something happened to your beautiful kids.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoplifting, on the other hand, tends to conjure images of </span><b>a teenager sneaking a comic book into his backpack</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a desperate man stealing a loaf of bread. Sometimes we envision a bored housewife </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying the "five finger discount"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a pair of coveted earrings, or a minimum wage worker trying to add a couple of small but unaffordable luxury items to their personal inventory. Designer sunglasses anyone?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Shoplifting and Organized Crime now go hand-in-hand</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as it turns out, neither of these is an accurate depiction of reality. Current statistics show that </span><b>shoplifting has swelled and grown into a $30 billion industry</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a direct impact on our nation's economy. According to the </span><a href="https://www.retailers.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Retailers Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, located in Lansing, shoplifting is no longer something we can dismiss as a "petty" crime. It is now far more organized and unbelievably prevalent. And amazingly, only about 20% of retail thieves are ever prosecuted.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is: why? Why has this issue developed into such an uncontrollable phenomena?  The answer is simple - money.  Professional thieves now enter the stores in teams, usually armed with a list of items they will be "shopping" for, and a plan of attack. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional shoplifters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have all sorts of </span><b>tricks for getting away with their crimes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like lining their purses with foil so that the anti-theft tags on stolen items don't set off alarms at the exit doors. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How do shoplifting teams go about their crimes?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does it work? Usually, it's a team effort. One person engages the clerk, distracting them with questions or conversation. The other person (or people) </span><b>stuff items into their bags at high speed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, being careful to keep their face down so that it's harder to identify them later in the surveillance video footage. Then, as unassumingly as possible, the group melt away through the exits and disappear into waiting cars.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And what do they do with all of this </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/financial-fraud-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stolen merchandise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? After all, a person only needs so many iPhones, teeth whitening strips, and colognes. But that's the rub - very few of these items are actually kept. Most of what is stolen is resold, usually online, for </span><b>a discount on the original store price</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because when you paid nothing for it, a discounted sale price is still a major profit margin. Sometimes these items make their way onto the shelves at small, independently owned convenience stores or party stores. One common example of that is baby formula that has been stolen for a major grocery store and then resold to the party store owner for a steep discount. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Current stats show that shoplifting costs each consumer $500 per year</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is all over the U.S. now, and Michigan hasn't been spared. According to the </span><a href="https://nrf.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Retail Federation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, every year the top ten list for cities with the highest incidents of organized retail crime is released. For a few years, namely 2013 and 2014, </span><b>Detroit made the nation's Top Ten</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in recent years, Michigan cities have dropped off the top ten in favor of places like Boston, Orlando, and Philadelphia.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2001 it was estimated that shoplifting cost retailers approximately $25 million per day. Yes, you read that right! And that was almost 15 years ago. </span><b>Can you image what it costs them now? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on that note, just image how much cheaper things would be if stores didn't have to mark up prices to account for the staggering losses they expect to face each day. In Michigan, our criminal law refers to shoplifting as “retail fraud.” </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How does Michigan law deal with shoplifting?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013 Michigan signed </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/retail-crime.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Organized Retail Crime statute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law. This allows prosecutors to charge anyone with felony retail fraud if they sold, or intended to sell, any items they stole. Before that, </span><b>items worth less than $1,000 would result in a misdemeanor retail fraud charge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That meant many people were able to get around doing hard time if they kept each theft under a grand.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As it stands, being charged with any kind of theft or organized crime in Michigan is very serious! You could be faced with years of prison time, hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in fines and court costs, and that's not counting the restitution you may have to pay!
