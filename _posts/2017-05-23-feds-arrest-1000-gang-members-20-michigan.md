&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In what is being called a 'record sweep', a total of </span><b>1,378 people have been arrested for gang related activity all over the country</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a coordinated effort by the Federal law enforcement agencies. The operation took a total of six weeks to execute, and will now result in months if not years of court dates and paperwork. However, while the majority of those arrests have no impact on Michigan whatsoever, the fact is that 20 of those people are actually locals.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">20 of those arrests took place in Michigan. Specifically, in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/genesee-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 13 were members of </span><b>Detroit-based gangs like the Latin Count, 18th Street, Cheddda Avenue and Surenos</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The remaining seven were from Flint, and represented three different gangs in the form of the Spanish Cobras, East Side Crips, and IMOB.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a statement released by </span><a href="https://www.ice.gov/hsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeland Security Investigations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">' Detroit Field Office, the people targeted by the sweep were suspected of being involved in a variety of different illegal activities. These included </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug trafficking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weapons smuggling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, human trafficking, sex trafficking, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and racketeering. However, only </span><b>1,095 of the people arrested were confirmed as gang members and affiliates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The remaining 280 were allegedly arrested for administrative immigration violations.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort was led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâ€™s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations. If it seems strange to you that a sweep like this would be instigated by immigrations and customs agents, it's </span><b>because many of the people suspected of gang related activities in the US are actually illegals from other countries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the recent spate of arrests, a full third of the people taken into custody were foreign nationals from a total of 21 different countries outside of the U.S. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it may have been ICE that led the effort, there were numerous agencies that participated. In Michigan alone, there were </span><b>many law enforcement agencies that provided assistance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Border Patrol</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Field Operations</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan State Police</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit Police Department</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flint Police Department</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation, which ran from March 26th to May 6th, is one of the largest coordinated anti-gang efforts ever conducted by law enforcement here in the U.S. Now, in the wake of the arrests, there will be </span><b>thousands of court dates, and likely, tens of thousands of months spent behind bars</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
