<h2>Meth Raid Finds Several "One-Pot" Meth Labs on Property</h2>
Ten people were arrested in Kalamazoo, MI this past Wednesday, after police from several departments conducted a raid on a property located in the 3100 block of North Pitcher Street.

Authorities say they received a tip that meth was being produced at the property and so a warrant was issued. Eighteen Kalamazoo Township police officers, along with members of the Southwest Commercial Auto Recovery unit and a Michigan State Police auto-theft team worked together. The number of officers involved was due to the size of the property and the number of outbuildings.

When they arrived, police found five adults outside the property, another five adults inside, and four adults and a baby in a car in the driveway. Two of the people in the yard attempted to flee through a nearby wooded area. They were tracked by the Kalamazoo K-9 unit to a factory north of the house. Of the 14 adults found at the scene, ten were arrested and taken to the Kalamazoo County Jail.

Police found three active 'one-pot' meth labs at the scene, along with “numerous other meth-related components.” A 12-gauge shotgun was also seized.

Child Protective Services was called to the scene for the infant. A worker placed the child with a relative. The mother, who had been in the vehicle, was arrested on <a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/practice-areas/child-abuse.html" target="_blank">child abuse</a> charges “due to the conditions to which her infant was exposed.”

Of the remaining 9 people, three men and four women were arrested for 13 outstanding warrants, including meth possession, fraud, and bench warrants for failure to appear for court proceedings.

One woman was arrested for violating the terms of her probation, which stems from a prior felony case. One of the men was arrested for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">methamphetamine</a> and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank">marijuana</a> possession, and another man was arrested for resisting and obstructing officers, and for being a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank">felon in possession of a firearm</a>. Their names have not yet been released.

Authorities intend to seek further charges for the production of meth and for resisting and obstructing police officers.
