<h3 dir="ltr">Unlawful Use of a Financial Transaction Device</h3>
Guests staying at the Holiday Inn Splash Universe in Dundee, MI may have got a little more than they bargained for in recent months. On their credit card bills, that is. Between November of 2013 and March 2014, a front desk clerk named Alivia Ann Adams was copying down credit card information and then passing it on to her boyfriend, Jason Lee Beverly, a former employee of the hotel. Using the stolen credit card information, the couple rang up charges in multiple counties in both Michigan and Ohio.

Police have said that Adams would call up businesses, offering to pay for goods or services as a gift for a friend or family member, but claiming she was unable to come in and pay in person. Businesses would take the compromised credit card information over the phone, and then Adams and Beverly would arrive later to redeem their purchases, pretending to be the recipients of the "gift".

<h2>The cards were used to buy items online</h2>

The compromised cards were frequently used to buy items online at Sears and Walmart. They were also used to buy food at restaurants, make car payments, and get vehicles serviced.

Adams and Beverly were arrested and held at the Monroe County Jail. Adams paid a $5,000 bond and was released. Beverly is still being held in lieu of $10,000 bond.

Both suspects have been charged with fraudulent use of a credit card and conspiracy to commit credit card fraud. Michigan law states that any person who knowingly acquires credit cards without the consent of the cardholder is guilty of a felony. Credit card fraud carries a maximum sentence of up to 4 years in prison.
