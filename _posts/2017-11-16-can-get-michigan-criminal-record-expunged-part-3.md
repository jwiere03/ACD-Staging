<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us one last time to wrap up the topic of </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expungement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of criminal convictions here in Michigan. If you're just finding this blog series now, we recommend you </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/can-get-michigan-criminal-record-expunged-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend a few minutes catching up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you've been with us from the star, let's dive right in…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Is there a difference between sealed and expunged records?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expungement is very similar to having a person's criminal records sealed from public viewing. What this means is that either specific parts, or all, of a criminal record will be unavailable to the public. Technically, there is a difference though. While </span><b>a sealed record means that the record still exists but cannot be viewed by the public without a court order</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an expunged record is not available for viewing by the public even with a court order. Sometimes however, people use the term "expunged" to incorrectly refer to sealed records.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Court documents for expungement must be done properly</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you've met all of the criteria for expungement in Michigan, and your crime isn't one of those that </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/possible-get-criminal-record-expunged-michigan-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disqualifies you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from being eligible, </span><b>you and your attorney will work together asking to get your criminal record expunged</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Usually, the process of expunging a criminal record involves drafting the correct documents, getting the court documents pertaining to the original case, and then filing the petition with the court. In most courts, this can be somewhat time consuming and confusing. After that, serving the papers to the correct parties is also quite confusing to many people. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that if your paperwork is drafted incorrectly, any required information was left out, or the petition was not submitted properly, the court will consider your request invalid. However, if you invest in an </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who will ensure that your paperwork is properly filed, then </span><b>the court will consider your application. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This involves weighing your “circumstances and behavior” against the “public welfare.” </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Your lawyer will have to prove to the court that you deserve expungement</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that it falls to you and your knowledgeable attorney to prove to the court that you deserve to have your criminal record erased from public view. </span><b>You will have to show the court evidence that your actions and behavior from the date of the conviction until the time of the application, are those of a law abiding citizen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Kronzek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who has handled numerous expungements, "You will have to prove that all of your actions and choices have been consistent with the goals of being a law abiding, productive citizen, and that you warrant the expungement of a </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal conviction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the court denies your petition, you may not file another petition about the same criminal conviction for three years after the date of the denial. </span><b>The only exception to this rule is if the court specifically names an earlier date</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If however, your petition is granted, you will have the benefit of being able to legally and rightfully claim that you do not have a criminal record.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Having your record expunged is life changing!</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although seeking an expungement can be a time consuming and somewhat costly process, the benefits can be enormous! </span><b>Being able to tell a prospective employer that you don't have a criminal record can have a significant impact on whether or not you are likely to get the job</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You may also be eligible for student loans that were previously unavailable to you, and also for financial assistance with housing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, you may also be eligible for a significant number of </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you might have been denied, had you been on record as a convicted criminal. </span><b>Careers like being a registered nurse or registered public accountant may now be viable options</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should also now be able to volunteer at your children's school, where running a background check is becoming more commonplace. </span><b>Let us help you prepare for a better future. </b>
