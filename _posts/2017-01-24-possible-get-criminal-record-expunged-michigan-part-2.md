<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for joining us again today, as we look at </span><b>what an expungement means in Michigan, and what you would need to know in order to pursue it for yourself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/possible-get-criminal-record-expunged-michigan-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we discussed exactly how Michigan law defines expungement, which crimes would disqualify you from being eligible for getting your criminal record expunged and what the application process involved.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you whose prior crimes have not disqualified you from applying for </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expungement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are still </span><b>certain criteria you will need to meet in order to request that the court set aside a criminal record</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please note the following:</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have only one felony conviction on your criminal record, and no more than two misdemeanors, in order to petition the court to dismiss the felony conviction.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have up to two misdemeanor convictions and no </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felonies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can request that the court expunge one or both of your misdemeanor convictions.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were convicted of </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan-4th-fourth-degree-criminal-sexual-conduct-csc-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourth Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before January 14th, 2015, and you have not been convicted of another crime (other than two “minor offenses”) since then, you may ask the court to set aside the conviction.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted in the previous article, five years must have elapsed since the last day of jail, sentence, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or discharge from parole, whichever is later.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who was convicted of </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/prostitution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prostitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may request that the court expunge their record if they were forced into the sex trade as a victim of human trafficking.</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that the term "minor offense" is very specific in its definition. Under Michigan law,</span><b> a 'minor offense' refers to a misdemeanor or ordinance violation for which the maximum imprisonment doesn't exceed 90 days</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and for which the maximum fine does not exceed $1,000.00. In addition, the law requires that in order for a crime to count as a minor offense, it must be committed by a person who isn't more than 21 years of age.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to juveniles applying for an expungement, there are different rules that the court abides by. </span><b>A juvenile may have adjudications set aside by the court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they have no more than three juvenile offenses on their record. In addition, they may not have any felony convictions on their record. For those of you who are unsure what an adjudication is, it's simply another way of saying "verdict" or "</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" which is handed down by the court.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A juvenile adjudication is not the same thing as an adult conviction, and in some cases, it doesn't even appear on the juvenile’s criminal record. There are, however, </span><b>certain instances where a juvenile adjudication will be entered into the public record</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in these situations, these individuals may choose to pursue getting that crime expunged from their criminal record. If you are unsure about your juvenile record, we urge you to contact an attorney to assist you.</span>
