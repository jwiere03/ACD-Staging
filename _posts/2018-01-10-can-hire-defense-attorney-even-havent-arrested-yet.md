&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people don't realize that their right to counsel begins even before any charges have been filed. That means that </span><b>you have a right to be represented by a lawyer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long before you've been arrested or charged with a crime. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many situations where people are in need of a criminal defense lawyer, and they don't even know it! For example, if </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the police are investigating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a crime and they bring you down to the police station "for questioning," </span><b>you should have an attorney present</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even although you haven't been arrested, and might never be, it's still a good idea to have good legal representation during almost any encounter with police during an investigation. What you think might be your chance to tell your side of the story, might really be an attempt to gather more evidence to convict you of a crime. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What good is hiring a lawyer before I'm even arrested?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An experienced criminal defense attorney has spent years developing methods and strategies that allow for </span><b>a proactive approach to protecting their clients</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each case is different, so a good criminal lawyer will assess the facts, determine what the possible outcomes are, and then work to construct a strong, proactive defense. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what's the purpose? Surely there isn't much an attorney could do if I haven't been arrested? After all, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawyers are for court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, right? Wrong! Lawyers are for </span><b>whenever you need legal help</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not sure what that means? Consider this…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The purpose of pre-arrest help from an attorney</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can't explain the strategies used by other defense attorneys, but here at The Kronzek Firm we have a three pronged approach. First, we work to </span><b>avoid having </b><b><i>any</i></b><b> charges filed against you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Believe it or not, having a lawyer on board from the very beginning can sometimes ensure that </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don't get arrested at all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!  We have developed our own protocol for handling pre-arrest cases that helps us to be position you in the event that charges are eventually filed against you. Often times, we can help you avoid being charged with a crime. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, we start working to construct a strong defense </span><b>in case you are arrested and charged</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in connection with this case in the future. And last but not least, we do whatever "damage control" is possible for your case, in the event that the prosecutor's office decides to file criminal charges against you later on. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What does a lawyer do to help me for before the arrest?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The techniques and procedures for creating your pre-arrest defense might include:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering information from the police about their investigation, and the conclusions they've drawn so far</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting an independent investigation (as opposed to using the information gathered by the police in their investigation)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locating and interviewing witnesses</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluating evidence</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching the law as it pertains to your case</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring forensic and scientific experts to review evidence and if the case goes to trial, testify on your behalf</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>A good defense begins with a good offense!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If we had a dollar for every time </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/reviews-testimonials-clients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we heard a client say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "I should have called you sooner!" we'd probably be able to take the entire state legislature out to lunch! The fact is, if you suspect the police may be </span><b>investigating you in connection with any Michigan crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or if a police officer has talked to you in connection with an investigation, you need to call us! We recommend that you never speak to the police without your lawyer being present. Explain that to the officer that is trying to discuss a case with you. </span>

&nbsp;
