<h2><b>5 Facing Charges After Teen's Death</b></h2>
On New Year's Eve, at a time when people around the world were gearing up to usher in the new year, a 16-year-old Watervliet HS student named Mason Mizwicki was dying of prescription methadone overdose. But now, in the wake of his death, five individuals are facing charges for the events that took place that night. Three of them are minors.<!--more-->

According to court records, police were called to an address in Watervliet, Berrien County, where the victim was found in his car, which was parked on the street. He was not breathing. Further investigation found that he had attended a New Year's Eve Party at a friend's home, where he had been supplied with alcohol and prescription drugs.

Currently charged in the wake of Mizwicki's death are the following individuals:

40-year-old Donald Jewell is facing 2 misdemeanor charges because it was his home that the party took place at, and because he furnished alcohol to minors, which is considered to be Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor.

16-year-old Zachary Jewell, Donald's son, is also facing a misdemeanor charge, namely Allowing Consumption of Alcohol or Controlled Substances on his Premises.

36-year-old Tara Teitsma is charged with Delivery of a Schedule II Controlled Substance (Methadone) Causing Death, which is a felony under Michigan law and punishable by up to life in prison. She is also charged with providing alcohol to minors, along with Xanax and Methadone. Â All in all, she is facing five felony charges, two of which are punishable by up to life in prison, and one misdemeanor.

16-year-old Tyler Taylor, Teitsma's son, is facing charges in juvenile court. Like his mother, he is charged with Delivery of a Schedule II Controlled Substance (Methadone) Causing Death and Conspiracy to Deliver (with his mother Tara Teitsma) a Schedule II Controlled Substance (Methadone) Causing Death - both felonies with possible life sentences. Additionally he is facing a number of other charges as a result of having provided the drugs to Mizwicki.

17-year-old Caleb Cox is being charged as an adult for having provided Xanax at the party, which is a schedule II controlled substance, making this a 4 year felony.

Tara Teitsma, Donald Jewell and Caleb Cox have all been arraigned, while the two 16-year-olds are awaiting court dates in juvenile court at a later date.
