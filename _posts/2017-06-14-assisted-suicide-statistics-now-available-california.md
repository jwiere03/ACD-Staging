Or nothing more than the crime of murder?[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assisted suicide, like abortion and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun control, tends to be a very polarizing issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People are either for it, or against it. There aren't many people who waiver. Certain well-known people, like Stephen Hawking, Diane Rehm, and Terry Pratchett, have advocated for the right-to-die over the years, which has fueled the debate even more. The question remains, though: </span><b>should a terminally ill person have the right to choose when and how they die?</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1997, the state of Oregon passed the first </span><a href="https://www.deathwithdignity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death with Dignity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law, allowing terminally ill residents of the state a chance to choose when they ended their lives. Over a decade later, in 2008, Washington followed suit. Gradually, the pace began to quicken. In 2013 Vermont passed right-to-die laws. In 2016 both Colorado and California joined the growing group. </span><b>So far this year, the District of Columbia has already made it legal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Maine is currently considering legislation that would legalize a terminally ill person's right to choose death. But what about Michigan?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently no bills that have been introduced that propose the right-to-die be made legal in Michigan. However, with</span><b> the slow trend showing movement in that direction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it probably won't be long before someone starts a petition to introduce the subject. (There is currently a petition going around in Florida lobbying for assisted suicide laws.) </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics were recently released from California, where </span><b>the right to die has been legal for exactly one year now</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During that time, 504 people contacted </span><a href="https://www.compassionandchoices.org/california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compassion &amp; Choices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is an advocacy group that provides information on the process. That number is exclusively for people who contacted Compassion &amp; Choices. The state of California hasn't released any information yet, which means that there could be considerably more people who have pursued the right to die in California.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Whitaker, the Compassion &amp; Choices' California director, told the media that these numbers show that the new law has '</span><b>provided comfort and relief from intolerable suffering,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just as (it) intended it to do." According to Whitaker, this option allows people struggling with terminal illnesses a chance to control how their life ends and retain their dignity. Detractors, however, say that it will lead to hastily-made decisions, medical misdiagnosis, and reduced support for palliative care.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>The issue is very hotly debated by people on both sides of the fence. But which one is correct?</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For some people, the process of discussing and planning for death is a straightforward one. After all, they say that </span><b>we plan for every other aspect of life's eventualities, why not plan for our death as well?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Between health insurance, flood insurance, prenuptial agreements, 401 K, retirement plans, and power of attorney we prepare for all of life's eventualities. So why, some people wonder, would we treat it any differently?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For most, the reason to treat the issue of assisted suicide differently is usually grounded in religious or spiritual beliefs. However, according to Death with Dignity, </span><b>approximately 7 in every 10 Americans are supporters</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of an individual's right to choose the time of their own death.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, under Michigan law, assisting anyone in their own suicide could be </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged as murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The permission and full consent of the terminally ill patient, and even the consent and support of their family would make no difference. Taking a life or aiding in ending a life Â in Michigan, under any circumstances, can be </span><b>considered to be homicide and may result in criminal charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
