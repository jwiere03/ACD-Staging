States all over the U.S. have outdated and ridiculous laws that are still on the books. And Michigan is no different. In most cases, these laws are never enforced, and no one ever ends up behind bars as a result. Why? Because no one even knows they're laws. And with good reason.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why Michigan lawmakers recently spent a week or so going back and weeding out some of the more obscure and unenforceable laws on our books. Like the fact that it is against the law to trespass on a cranberry, huckleberry, or blackberry marsh here in Michigan. And that it's illegal to sing the national anthem in a non-traditional manner. Oh, and that one about it being illegal to prohibit endurance contests, like walk-a-thons? Which would probably mean every 5k you've ever participated in was illegal, too. Yes, crazy stuff.</span>


<h2>Governor is in favor of repealing outdated laws</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill package, which contains seven separate bills addressing a total of 80 laws, was recently passed by the Senate and is making it's way to Governor Snyder's desk. It is likely to be well received, as the Governor has said that he is in favor of repealing outdated laws so obsolete that they are no longer enforceable.</span>

It's hard to imagine, but as of right now it is against the law in Michigan to use certain words, like "lost manhood," in printed advertisements that pertain to sexually transmitted disease. Yes, you read that right. And did you know that just about every hair salon and cosmetology school in Michigan is violating state law on an almost continuous basis? Why? Because it is illegal in Michigan for a woman to cut her hair without her husband's permission.

Michigan has thousands of laws on the books, with a recent tally putting the number at close to 3,100. But many of them are well over a hundred years old, and have little or nothing to do with life today. Like the law that prohibits a doctor from displaying the remains of a deceased person with deformities.

Now-a-days, with laws in place that protect the bodies of the dead from violation, and laws that protect all people, regardless of race, creed, gender and disabilities, this would likely never happen anyway. And if something like this were to be discovered, the public outcry and loss of viable business alone would probably take care of that doctor's professional reputation for good.

The effort to start repealing old and outdated laws in Michigan was started by State Rep Chris Afendoulis. He claims that his effort is only the first step, however. Next year he plans to get a group working on repealing another batch of outdated laws. AndÂ according to Afendoulis, this first push was the easy stuff. Moving forward, he hopes to address some of the harder subjects.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing some of the state's more antiquated laws repealed, and hope for a day when searching through Michigan's penal code is a slightly less cumbersome endeavor.</span>
