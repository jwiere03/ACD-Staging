&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if they've never </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most people can tell you that simply being charged with a crime is going to cost you! Going to jail might mean losing your job and hiring an experienced attorney to defend you is expensive. (You never want to hire a cheap attorney. Most attorneys understand their own value.) However, when you stop and think about it, </span><b>the cost of a criminal conviction goes far beyond the issue of money</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The costs, as it were, are much more than financial!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to money and a viable income, a criminal record can also cost you relationships, the ability to get a good job, and respectability in your community. And that's still not all! In addition to </span><b>all of the intangible ways that having a criminal record will cost you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are also the many rights you will lose as a result. Both state and federal laws are very specific about the fact that convicted felons may not do, participate in, or own, certain things. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what do you lose out on with a criminal record? How is your future affected? The list of your potential losses is enormous, and it looks like this:</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>You LOSE The Right to Bear Arms:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both federal and Michigan law says that a convicted felon may not legally own or possess a </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun or firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any kind. In addition, Michigan law also forbids a convicted felon from getting a concealed carry permit. (You </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">might</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be eligible to restore your gun rights after a lengthy waiting period. Check out  </span><a href="http://www.restoremygunrights.info"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.RestoreMyGunRights.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more details!)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>You LOSE The Right to Join the Military:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've been convicted of a </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony in Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, regardless of how long ago the crime took place, or what you did, you're forbidden from serving in the military. This includes all branches of the armed forces - Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and National Guard.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>You LOSE The Right to Serve on a Jury:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan state law does not allow anyone who has been convicted of a felony to serve on a jury in a Michigan court.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>You Might LOSE Your Professional License:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being convicted of a crime often results in the</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> loss of a professional license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doctors, lawyers, nurses, teachers, counselors, police officers, cosmeticians, contractors, fire fighters, builders and accountants are all required to have licenses in order to do their jobs. Depending on the profession or industry, many licensed individuals have a duty to report a criminal charge or conviction to their professional licensing board. In many cases, a criminal conviction results in the loss of their job!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>You LOSE The Right to own a Michigan Liquor License: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Convicted felons in Michigan are not allowed by law to own a liquor license. This means that you wouldn't be able to own or operate a bar or restaurant that serves </span><a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/michigan-drunk-driving-misdemeanors.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liquor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (This doesn't mean, however, that you can't work as a waitress, waiter, or bartender in one of these establishments.  Only the owner is required to have a Michigan liquor license!)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>You LOSE The Right to own a Gaming (Casino) license:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of jobs that a person can get at a casino here in Michigan, requires that you have a license from the Michigan Gaming Commission. For those who've been convicted of a felony here in Michigan, you're immediately disqualified from receiving this </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
