<h2>Kalamazoo Woman Arrested on Warrant</h2>
There has been a long standing joke about the fact that a person needs a license to drive a car, own a dog and catch a fish, but anyone can have a child. However, while dog licenses may be something of a joking matter to some people, Becky Rehr isn't laughing.<!--more-->

Rehr received multiple notices from the Kalamazoo County Animal Control over a period of several months, that she had not renewed her dog's license. Finally, three and a half months late, Rehr went and took care of that little issue. And then didn't give it another thought.

Until she received a notification in the mail a few days later, telling her that, courtesy of her delinquency in taking care of her dog's license, there was now a warrant out for her arrest. Rehr was, naturally, horrified. A warrant? For a delinquent dog license? Insanity!

Some time later, Rehr stopped by the Kalamazoo County Sheriff’s Office with her 14-year-old daughter. She brought her dog's new license with her, just to prove that she had taken care of it and it was no longer an issue. But apparently that was not the case. Rehr was arrested on the spot, frisked, fingerprinted and placed in a holding cell.

Rehr posted bond and was released, but was then faced with a charge hanging over her head. A charge that has caused a stir all around the state. A single misdemeanor count that could mean up to 90 days in jail and a fine of up to $100.

But for Rehr, there was a happy ending in sight. The Kalamazoo County Prosecutor's Office filed a dismissal, dropping the charges after they received the paperwork stating that Rehr had actually taken care of her dog license. She will even get her bail money returned to her.

It is not certain what will happen next because of Rehr's experience. Perhaps a future change in legislation regarding dog licenses? Or perhaps the residents of Kalamazoo County will simply be a little more particular about keeping their dog licenses up to date? Or maybe arrests for overdue library books are next?  Who knows. Only time will tell….
