<span style="font-weight: 400">Cops and feds and numerous other law enforcement personnel are renowned for bending the law to suit them in TV shows and movies. And who could blame them - </span><b>they are almost always the good guys onscreen, furiously hunting very bad guys who have to be stopped at all costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. In most cases, the audience doesn't bat an eye at this violation of civil rights because we all understand the facts - it's done in the service of a good story. It's not real life. </span>But what about when it is?

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The detention center in Leavenworth, a federal prison in Topeka, Kansas, is privately owned and operated by </span><a href="http://www.cca.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Corrections Corporation of America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. According to media sources in Kansas, they are accused of doing exactly that! </span><b>The investigation that revealed these disturbing allegations started last summer in the wake of concerns that were raised by a defense attorney.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The attorney claimed that video recordings had been made of meetings they had with their client in </span><a href="https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/lvn/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Leavenworth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which is a violation of the attorney/client privilege which assures confidentiality. </span><b>The inmates who were allegedly recorded discussing legal matters with their attorneys, were accused of being involved in a smuggling ring inside the prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The U.S. Attorney's office had been investigating the smuggling ring and was gathering evidence in order to prosecute its members.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Evidence was provided by a number of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank">defense attorneys</a> who represented inmates in the prison, </span><b>revealing that both in-person meetings and phone calls between defense attorneys and their clients had been recorded</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. This is said to have happened even when those attorneys specifically requested that their numbers be blocked from recordings.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>A federal judge investigated, and discovered that prisoner's rights had been violated.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">A federal judge, David Cohen, was named Special Master and assigned the task of investigating the allegations. The investigation, which took months, revealed that </span><b>authorities at Leavenworth had been recording these private conversations.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> According to Special Master Cohen, when he explained the findings in court recently, he reviewed a small sample of meetings that took place in a room with a camera, and discovered that they were indeed recorded.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Based on this information, the Special Master noted that attorney visitor logs for the 12-week period during which time recordings took place, showed </span><b>more than 700 attorney visits to rooms that were equipped with cameras.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> He did point out that despite the fact that <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank">illegal recordings</a> have been confirmed, there is no evidence one way or another to prove if the recordings were ever watched.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao" target="_blank">U.S. Attorney’s Office</a>, who received the recordings, has refused to acknowledge that any misconduct has occurred. In a statement made by Assistant U.S. Attorney Erin Tomasic, he claims that </span><b>he definitely "made a mistake" </b><span style="font-weight: 400">but that “no employee of the United States Attorney’s Office or law enforcement officer” viewed any of the recording provided to them by Corrections Corporation of America.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">An attorney being able to have a </span><b>private and protected meeting with their incarcerated clients is a foundational principle of the United States legal system</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Calling it into question raises issues about how many other areas of violation there have been in the past that went unnoticed, or unreported.</span>
