&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An Ypsilanti man was stopped from flying out of the country recently, and then </span><b>arrested by the FBI’s counterterrorism team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The FBI is said to have discovered</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illegal weapons in a storage unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the man owned. He and his family were about to board a flight to Jordan, when officials stopped him and then arrested him.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to numerous media sources, 28-year-old Yousef Mohammad Ramadan hasn't yet been charged with a terror-related crime. As of now, he is only </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facing gun charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but many people are interpreting </span><b>the involvement of the FBI's counter-terrorism unit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s national security unit, to mean that Ramadan is suspected of being involved in a terror threat against the US.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal documents reveal that Ramadan told FBI agents, during an undisclosed interview, that he owned a Glock handgun and two rifles. He admitted to nothing else and denied owning any other weapons. At first he claimed to have </span><b>put his three weapons in a self storage unit whose location he couldn't recall</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then he changed the story, and admitted to the feds that he had given his weapons to a friend, but refused to reveal that friend's identity.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI agents discovered the location of Ramadan's storage unit, somewhere in Ann Arbor, and conducted a raid. Inside the storage unit, officers discovered </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two handguns with the serial numbers filed away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Obliterating the serial number on a gun is a federal crime and a state of Michigan crime. According to WXYZ television new in Detroit, the FBI has been watching Ramadan, and has seen footage of him </span><b>driving his sister's car to the storage unit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the guns were found. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Very little information is available about the case, which seems to have left many people speculating about the possibilities. Ramadan was brought into Federal Court on Saturday, </span><b>which is very rare as the Court is usually closed over the weekend</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During the arraignment, which wasn't posted on the court calendar, Ramadan was charged with Possession of a Firearm with an Obliterated Serial Number, which is a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five-year felony under Federal Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Federal Magistrate Judge who oversaw the arraignment denied Ramadan bond. That left him waiting developments in the Wayne County Jail.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramadan is scheduled for a detention hearing yesterday morning in Federal Court. Although the FBI is being </span><b>very close-lipped about the investigation </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and very few details have been revealed, we do know certain things. For example, the lead investigator is FBI Special Agent Ryan Schanberger, who is a member of the specialized counterterrorism squad that investigated Sebastian Gregerson, who pled guilty to possession of explosives and is suspected of being part of a larger terrorist plot.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also know that the prosecutor overseeing this case is Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Tukel. Tukel is the chief of the national security unit that prosecuted Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, also known as the "underwear bomber." </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Ramadan has not been charged with any terror-related charges, the involvement of Assistant U.S. Attorney Tukel and FBI Special Agent Schanberger has led many to speculate that Ramadan is suspected of being involved in </span><b>some kind of terror threat against the U.S.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, as we often remind our readers, it's best not to assume anything until all of the facts are known, because </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">situations can turn on a dime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Either way, we will be keeping an eye on this case, and will keep you updated if anything of interest develops.</span>
