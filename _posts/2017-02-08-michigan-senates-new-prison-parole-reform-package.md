<span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 is looking to be the year of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-parole-board-reversal.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parole</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prison reform here in Michigan. </span><b>Almost half of the 52 bills the Senate reviewed in their last session were to do with prison and parole reform</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We wanted to share with you the issues that some of those bills are hoping to address in the future.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican </span><a href="http://www.senatorrickjones.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senator Rick Jones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who was a sheriff in Eaton County, MI for years before pursuing a career in politics. He was the primary supporter of several of these bills. In statements made to the Senate about his bills, he said that </span><b>the primary reasons were to make the system better, reduce recidivism, and save the state a lot of money</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another focus he hopes the bills will address is helping inmates to get settled back into civilian life successfully after their release. "We want people put out that do not recidivate that find jobs and return as a citizen." he explained. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Senator Jones' bills aims at allowing prison inmates access to a program that is currently restricted to jails - </span><b>earning time off for good behavior if they complete certain programs or refrained from bad behavior while in prison.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This could include certain </span><a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sobriety programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anger management programs, and also schooling to learn a trade or get a high school diploma. Michigan used to have “good time credit” in prisons, but that was eliminated by our “Truth In Sentencing” law passed when John Engler was the governor. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills introduced by Democratic Senators </span><a href="http://senatedems.com/warren/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebekah Warren</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://senatedems.com/johnson/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bert Johnson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focused on rehabilitation for prison inmates. The goal, according to Warren, would be to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rehabilitate inmates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>prepare them for a productive life outside prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once they are released. As a bonus, the changes would also save the government money.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Senator Warren's bills aims to donate a portion of the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/restitution.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crime victims fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to child assessment centers here in Michigan. Another bill hopes to </span><b>establish a county jail bed savings program, which would allow counties that chose to participate to house eligible inmates in their facilities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This would mean that inmates housed there could be housed in a less restrictive environment. Ideally, if enough counties participates it would mean that the state could close a prison, which would mean significant savings.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills introduced hope to discontinue services to parole absconders and also changing the penalties that probationers must submit to when they have committed a technical, or minor </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation violation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>All in all, there are some interesting bills headed for the Michigan House for consideration.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan prison system, Michigan Department of Corrections, has long been under scrutiny for everything from bad food to overcrowding. 2016 saw initiatives aimed at </span><a href="https://www.thecleanteam.xyz/michigan-senate-approves-criminal-justice-overhaul.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauling the state's prison system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the process will be a long and arduous one.</span>
