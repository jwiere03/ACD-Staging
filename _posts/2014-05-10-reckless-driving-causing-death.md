<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Detroit Man Causes Car Crash, Killing Three </span></h2>
Michael Anthony Miller, a 22-year-old resident of Detroit, MI, was arraigned last week on three counts of reckless driving causing death, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor’s office.

On August 18th, 2013, four men - a Grand Rapids man, his father and his nephew, along with another passenger- were all traveling home from a Detroit Tigers game. Just after midnight, on the John C. Lodge Freeway near Rosa Parks Boulevard in Detroit, they were hit by a vehicle traveling in the same direction at high speed. Their car rolled over in the crash.

The Detroit Fire Department arrived and attempted to administer aid, cutting the seatbelts on all four injured passengers to free them. The fourth unnamed passenger sustained non-life threatening injuries. But three of the four men, 68-year-old Brian Kelley, 31-year-old Daniel Kelly and 19-year-old Keeland Johns, were pronounced dead at a local hospital shortly afterwards.

Police who investigated the scene say that Miller was traveling at a high rate of speed in the northbound lanes of the John C. Lodge Freeway, when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into the other car containing the four west Michigan men. Miller was unharmed in the accident. Police say that alcohol and speed were factors in the accident.

Under Michigan law, someone who causes another person's death as a result of reckless driving is guilty of a felony, which is punishable by imprisonment for up to 15 years, or a fine of no less than $2,500.00 and no more than $10,000.00, or both.
