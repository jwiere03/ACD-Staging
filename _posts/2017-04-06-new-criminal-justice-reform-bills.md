&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing recidivism among the former </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inmates in Michigan has long been a goal of lawmakers and politicians in our state. However, wanting something and actually being able to achieve it are often very different things. So when our Governor said that he planned to reform the criminal justice system in Michigan, </span><b>replacing outdated and unsuccessful laws with ones that made more sense for everyone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many people shrugged their shoulders. After all, talk is cheap. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears, however, that the Governor may have come through on his promise of 'smart justice' for Michigan. A </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-senates-new-prison-parole-reform-package.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new 18-bill package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spearheaded by Senator John Proos and signed into law by Governor Snyder, overhauls many aspects of our criminal justice system. In particular, the new laws aim to </span><b>drastically reduce recidivism and also overhaul Michigan's probation and parole laws</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Senator Proos has referred, on a number of occasions, to Michigan's corrections system as a 'revolving door'. </span><b>People are shuffled in as inmates where they serve time, only to be released without any help for how to settle into a productive life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a result, ill equipped and often shunned, they return to the only life they knew - </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- which puts them right back where they started. And so it goes, around and around. These new laws aim to break that cycle.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only portion of the initial package that didn't make it through the House was the bill incentivizing employers to hire felony parolees. Had the bi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll made it, the Michigan Department of Talent and Economic Development would have been required to establish </span><b>a grant program that offers financial incentives to employers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who hire people on probation or parole. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under our new law, there will be more data collection, increased reporting, and greater coordination between various state departments. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, there is now a maximum of only 30 days' incarceration for parolees who commit technical violations. Also, </span><b>prisoners aged 18 to 22 Â must be offered rehabilitation programs designed for youth rehabilitation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the Michigan Department of Corrections will be tasked with creating.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addressing the new laws, Governor Snyder said, "We've done some great things over the past several years like specialty courts, other ways to find people that may have a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigans-mental-health-courts-new-face-justice-2.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or something else that are better treated than being put into a correctional institution. </span><b>This is another big step to say as they come through that process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how do we help them get on the path to success?"</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan Department of Corrections has long been under scrutiny for everything from sexual abuse by guards, bad food and maggot infestation to overcrowding. 2016 saw initiatives introduced that aimed to overhaul the state's prison system, and 2017 has brought with it new laws crafted for that purpose. </span><b>The process is likely to be a long and arduous one, with bumps in the road along the way.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, we Michiganders are used to bumps in the road, right? This is why an experienced criminal defense attorney can make all the difference when dealing with a legal system still undergoing transformation.</span>
