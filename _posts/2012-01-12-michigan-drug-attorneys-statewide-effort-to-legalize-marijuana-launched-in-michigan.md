There are few issues in the law that get people riled up like the legalization of marijuana. Supporters of legalizing pot feel too many government resources are spent on prosecuting people for <a title="Michigan Marijuana Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html">marijuana drug crimes</a> when marijuana is not as dangerous as other substances that are already legal in Michigan. People who oppose legalization fear that society will go downhill if people are allowed to use marijuana as they please.

This debate is about to heat up in Michigan. There is a statewide campaign to gather enough signatures to place pot legalization on the ballot. If this measure gets placed on the ballot and receives sufficient voter approval, the Michigan Constitution will be amended to allow cannabis use, possession, manufacture, and sale by people who are at least 21 years old.


<h2>Michigan Medical Marijuana Act is known for being very vague</h2>

Currently, Michigan law allows for <a title="Michigan Medical Marijuana Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/medical-marijuana.html">medical marijuana</a> use. However, cannabis activists feel that police and prosecutors are going out of their way to prosecute legal weed patients and caregivers. The Michigan Medical Marijuana Act (MMMA) is known for being very vague, allowing law enforcement to interpret that law very narrowly in their favor. Of course pot is still unlawful under the federal law.

Many times, medical marijuana patients and caregivers think they have protection under the MMMA only to find out they have been charged with a marijuana crime (such as use, possession, manufacture, creation, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture, create, or deliver) because the authorities accuse them of non-compliance with the medical marijuana law in Michigan. Those people charged with a <a title="Drug Crimes Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/other-drug-crimes.html">drug crime</a> should contact a trained and successful drug crime defense lawyer immediately.
