<span style="font-weight: 400;">37-year-old Timothy England </span><b>escaped from police custody in Tennessee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He was caught by police officers in Michigan after what law enforcement calls a "crime spree" across several states. England is also </span><b>accused of assaulting the officer who finally arrested him here in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to police in Tennessee, England was awaiting trial for </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank Robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Brandishing a Weapon, when he </span><b>escaped from the Washington County Detention Center in Jonesborough, TN</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The escape happened on August 30, 2016. He then fled the state, heading north and ended up here in Michigan. He was arrested in Royal Oak which is in Oakland County, not too far from The Kronzek Firm’s Oakland County office.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrest happened not because police were already on the lookout for England, but rather because an </span><b>officer noted what he believed was suspicious behavior from the suspect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The officer allegedly saw England getting into a car in a parking lot on 11 Mile Road and then inject himself with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narcotics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cop </span><b>tried to pull England from the car and the result was a fight</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He then managed to get away and flee the scene, but was chased by the arresting officer and finally caught. England apparently then </span><b>tried to stab the officer several times with the syringe he had used to inject himself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was unsuccessful.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Backup officers arrived on scene and gave chase. After a second scuffle, where England tried to squeeze through a narrow gap in the parking structure wall, he was finally captured. Police say that he </span><b>fought them during the arrest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and officers </span><b>had to use a taser to subdue and arrested him</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He was then transported to a local hospital for an undisclosed medical condition.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After his arrest, officers discovered that the car England had been in was actually </span><b>a stolen vehicle, missing from North Carolina</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has apparently gone missing on August 31. In addition, he was discovered to have </span><b>a stolen credit card in his possession. It had been taken from someone in Virginia</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>England's criminal record is extensive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including convictions for Robbery, Resisting Arrest, Drugs, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fleeing and Eluding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Assault of a Police Officer, Auto Theft, and Having Contraband in a Penal Facility. After his arrest in Royal Oak, England was charged by the Oakland County Prosecutor with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felonious Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a Police Officer, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possession of Narcotics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Possession of a Stolen Vehicle, and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-cancelled-revoked-financial-transaction-device.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possession of a Stolen Credit Card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He was granted a bail of $100,000 and his next court appearance was scheduled for September 20.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Royal Oak Police Chief Corrigan O’Donohue, "There is no doubt in my mind that this </span><b>dangerous individual was in Royal Oak to commit an act of violence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since escaping from Tennessee authorities, he has been on a multistate crime spree. That crime spree came to an end in Royal Oak, thanks to outstanding proactive police work."</span>
