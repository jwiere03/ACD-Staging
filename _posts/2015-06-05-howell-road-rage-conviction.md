<h2><b>Martin Zale Faces up to Life in Prison</b></h2>
Most people have experienced frustration when trying to get somewhere in a hurry, and the person in front of you drives 10 miles under the speed limit in a no passing zone. Few things are more annoying when you're running late than getting stuck behind the world's slowest garbage truck, or a little old lady out for a Sunday drive. But it's how you act on that emotion that matters.

Martin Edward Zale, the 69-year-old man now convicted of second degree murder, didn't handle his anger well. Â Sadly, this road rage incident left a man is dead.<!--more-->

Derek Flemming, a husband and father of two, was annoyed by the erratic and dangerous driving of another motorist - Martin Zale. After a few near misses, he and Zale ended up at the same stop light, and Flemming got out of his car to confront Zale about his driving. He was unarmed and, according to witnesses, he made no threats.

But Zale, who has a history of road rage related incidents, apparently felt threatened. The two men ended up out of their cars and shouting at each other in the street. According to witness testimony Zale suddenly, and completely without warning, raised a gun and shot Flemming in the face. According to Zale, Flemming threatened him and punched him in the face.

Zale was charged with open murder, discharging a weapon from a vehicle, and two counts of felony firearm. He was bound over for trial, which took place in the Livingston County Circuit Court. Zale took the stand in his own defense, where he told jurors that he had intended to kill Flemming when he shot him. However, he pointed out that his actions were self defense only, as he thought Flemming was about to attack him.

The jury took approximately two days to deliberate before returning a guilty verdict on all four counts. Under Michigan law, second degree murder is punishable by up to life in prison. According to Zale's attorney, the family intends to appeal the verdict.

Zale is scheduled to be sentenced at 2 pm this afternoon, June 5th, by Judge Miriam Cavanaugh in Howell.H
