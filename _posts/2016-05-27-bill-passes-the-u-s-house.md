<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tide is slowly turning. For decades drug users have been viewed in a terrible light. Some see them as  good-for-nothings who leach from society without contributing anything of value to their communities. Re-thinking the issue, the horrific number of lives lost to substance abuse over the years and the substantial amount of government resources that have been wasted in trying to fight the "</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html">war on drugs</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">" has proven that substance abuse needs to be viewed in a different light if we are ever going to successfully overcome it.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"There have been more victims in this battle than should be called criminals. What we have been doing has not been working. There is a better way." These are the words of seventh district Michigan Congressman Tim Walberg. Walberg recently saw one of the bi-partisan bills he co sponsored, entitled the Infant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act, pass the United States House.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this bill makes it all the way past the Senate and to the president's desk to be signed into law, it will ensure that babies born with drug addictions are cared for and kept safe. The Act will also require that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which oversees </span><a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children’s Protective Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan, does a better job of ensuring that CPS is following state guidelines when responding to child abuse and neglect situations.</span>

&nbsp;


<h2>These laws protect the caregivers, law enforcement personnel and first responders</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the Infant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act, the House also passed a number of other bills aimed at dealing with the country's current opioid epidemic. For example, the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5048"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Samaritan Assessment Act (H.R. 5048</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ) will require that the Government Accountability Office submit a report reviewing state and local Good Samaritan laws. These laws protect the caregivers, law enforcement personnel and first responders who administer opioid overdose reversal drugs from being prosecuted as criminals.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill in the package is the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4063"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act (H.R. 4063)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which aims to promote responsible opioid use and improve the way that opioid therapy is administered to veterans being treated for pain. The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5052/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Act (H.R. 5052)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate the effectiveness of grant programs that provide assistance in addressing problems pertaining to opioid abuse," according to the wording of the bill itself.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, is the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5046/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act of 2016 (HR 5046)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed by a vote of 413 to 5. This bill would authorize the United States Department of Justice to provide grants to state, local and tribal governments to provide services for combating opioid abuses. </span>
