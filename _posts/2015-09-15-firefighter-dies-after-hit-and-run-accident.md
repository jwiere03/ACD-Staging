<h2>Witnesses Say the Hit-and-Run Was Intentional</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People charged with murder always face an uphill battle in their own defense. But when the victim was a child, or a person well-loved or respected by their community, the situation almost always worsens for the defendant. Aside from the inevitable media storm that follows, public outrage can engulf a case, leading to harsher charges from prosecutors hoping to sate an enraged populace, and tainted trial juries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grant Jacob Taylor, the 22-year-old Lansing man accused of murdering firefighter Dennis Rodeman in an intentional hit-and-run collision, is in exactly that position. Rodeman was everything the American populace loves. A firefighter, a war veteran, a newlywed with a child on the way. At the time of the incident, he was collecting donations for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill the Boot fundraiser, run by local fire departments for the <a href="http://www.mda.org/" target="_blank">Muscular Dystrophy Association</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The city of Lansing is heartbroken. And Taylor is facing a mammoth battle.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to police, the incident took place on Wednesday, September 9th, at about 3:40 in the afternoon. Rodeman was standing in the center </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lane, near the Cedar Street and Jolly Road intersection, when he was struck. Lansing police are alleging that Rodeman and Taylor exchanged words, after which Taylor drove away in his pickup truck, and then turned around and drove back, hitting Rodeman intentionally. Numerous witnesses saw the incident and were able to provide police with Taylor's license plate number.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency responders provided critical care to Rodeman before transporting him to the hospital. But unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save his life. Rodeman was declared dead at Sparrow hospital at about 6:30pm. Taylor fled the scene of the hit-and-run accident in his pickup truck, and police caught up to him blocks from his home. He apparently leapt from his truck and fled on foot, but officers caught him after a very brief chase.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor was arraigned in the Ingham County District Court before </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magistrate Laura Millmore. The magistrate chose to deny Taylor bond due to the seriousness of the charges. He has been charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">first degree murder</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/motor-vehicle-charges.html" target="_blank">failing to stop at the scene of a personal injury accident causing death</a>, and two counts of third degree <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">fleeing and eluding</a>. All four charges are very serious felonies, but it is the murder charge that could put him behind bars for life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A preliminary examination has been scheduled for September 23rd, where the Judge will attempt to determine whether or not there is enough evidence to bind the case over for trial. However, according to Ingham County Prosecuting Attorney Stuart Dunnings III, the prosecutor's office is already certain that they have enough evidence, and will be going to trial.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This hit-and-run accident is still under investigation by the Lansing Police Department. We will keep you updated as events unfold, and new information becomes available.</span>
