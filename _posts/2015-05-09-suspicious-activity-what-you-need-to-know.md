When people hear the term 'suspicious activity', they commonly think of the things they see in movies shortly before something explodes or a high speed chase ensues. Furtive glances, sweating and mumbling, trying to get out before someone notices what's wrong with the picture. And that is certainly part of it. But that is not all.<!--more-->

We decided to explain to our readers what exactly suspicious activity is, when considered from a law enforcement perspective, in part because knowing can help to avert disaster. But also because sometimes people do things without thinking. Without realizing what it may look like. And those things can result in being reported and possibly arrested, before everyone figures out that it was all a mistake.

So, in the interest of reporting an actual crime that requires police attention, and avoiding being accused of something you never intended to do, we have it defined for you below.

<h2>Homeland Security's working definition of suspicious activity:</h2>

<b>Unusual items or situations: </b>A car parked in an odd location, a package or piece of luggage left unattended, a window or door that has been left open that is normally closed, or any other out-of-the-ordinary or different from routine situations.

<b>Eliciting information:</b> A person who questions individuals in a way that suggests interest beyond normal curiosity about a building’s security procedures, personnel, shift changes, or any other information usually not of interest to strangers.

<b>Observation/surveillance:</b> Someone pays an unusual amount of attention to facilities or buildings beyond normal casual, or even professional interest. This could include loitering without explanation for long periods (particularly in concealed locations); repeated, or prolonged observation of a building (for example, the use of binoculars or a camera); taking physical notes about a business or building, like measurements or a floor plan sketch.  All of these could be considered suspicious activity.

The <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/" target="_blank">Homeland Security website</a> does point out that some of these activities may be innocent, but that this is for law enforcement to determine. We want to point this out to you so that you will exercise caution and awareness in your activities in public.

For example, when traveling via airplane, be certain to keep your carry on luggage with you at all times. The most obvious reason is to avoid having your belongings stolen. But in today's high alert world, with such frequent terror threats, an unattended bag at an airport, even for a few minutes, can bring all terminal activity to a screeching halt. This goes for children as well. If you are traveling with children, be sure to remind them regularly and keep a close watch on their bags.

It is important to note that factors such as a person's ethnicity, race and religion are not considered "suspicious".  It is only situations and activities that should be reported.
