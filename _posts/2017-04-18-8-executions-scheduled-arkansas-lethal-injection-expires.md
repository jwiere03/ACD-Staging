&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If officials in Arkansas had their way, yesterday would have been the first of eleven execution days. After more than a decade without performing a single legal </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">execution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>the state of Arkansas had planned to administer a lethal injection to eight inmates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within a matter of days. However, since scheduling the back-to-back executions, authorities have run into a number of obstacles.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the many protests that have been held throughout the state, Holy Thursday brought a letter, signed by over 200 faith leaders from all over Arkansas, begging the governor to reconsider. The Arkansas Governor, Republican Asa Hutchinson, scheduled the executions for what some are saying is an unsafe period of time. Even </span><b>former corrections department officials have gone on the record to advise slowing the schedule</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the grounds that rushing this sort of thing increases the chance of mistakes.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind the rush is the fact that </span><a href="https://www.drugs.com/cdi/midazolam.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">midazolam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a critical component in the 3 drug cocktail used for lethal injections, is set to expire at the end of the month. Should the executions be postponed beyond the end of April, they could be postponed indefinitely, due to </span><b>shortages in the supply of the necessary drugs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Midazolam is used to induce unconsciousness, reduce anxiety and cause muscle relaxation.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the holiday weekend, a federal judge issued an order temporarily staying the executions. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This order came on the heels of another order which had already ordered that certain individual executions planned in Arkansas were to be stayed, and also banning the state from using its lethal injection drug supply. District Judge Kristine Baker wrote, "</span><b>The threat of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs is significant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: if midazolam does not adequately anesthetize plaintiffs, or if their executions are 'botched,' they will suffer severe pain before they die." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the court orders, </span><b>several drug companies have stepped up to petition the court, asking that their products not be used in connection with the death penalty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In one case, </span><a href="http://www.mckesson.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKesson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pharmaceutical company, has accused the state of Arkansas of misleading them about the reason for purchasing vecuronium bromide, which they intend to use in the executions, and then going back on their promise to return the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the state of Arkansas is determined to overcome these obstacles and go through with the 8 planned executions as quickly as possible. In a statement, released by the office of Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, it is said that </span><b>the inmates' defense attorneys are taking advantage of the legal system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "In reality — like this entire proceeding — Appellees' request is nothing more than an attempt to manipulate the judicial process and make it impossible for Arkansas to carry out Appellees' just and lawful sentences." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6722" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are set to take place in pairs, are scheduled as follows:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">April 17th: Don Davis (27) and Bruce Ward (32)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">April 20th: Lendell Lee (27) and Stacey Johnson (23)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">April 24th: Jack Jones (30) and Marcell Williams (24)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">April 27th: Jason McGehee (20) and Kenneth Williams (20)</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a legal form of punishment in 31 states and also by the federal government. However, Michigan is not one of them. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, "</span><b>Michigan became the first English-speaking territory in the world to abolish capital punishment in 1847.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Treason remained a crime </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punishable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the death penalty in Michigan despite the 1847 abolition, but no one was ever executed under that law."</span>
