<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually when you hear about a backstabbing friend, it's a reference to someone who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized a friend in a treacherous way (usually behind their back) while still pretending to be friends. But in this particular case the definition is a lot more liter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">al. 41-year-old </span><b>Roberto R. Garza from Gibson Township in </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bay-county-criminal-attorney-bay-city-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><b>Bay County</b></a><b> is headed to trial this week for actually stabbing his friend in the back</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a knife.</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> records reveal that the incident took place on April 5, 2106 in the evening. Garza had been hired to do some work around the house for his friend, Steven Bryce. When the work was completed, Bryce took him home and then went on to fix a flat tire on his car. In his preliminary examination testimony, Bryce admits that </span><b>the pair hadn't discussed or agreed on payment ahead of time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which may have contributed to the Garza's frustration when his friend returned later that evening with $50 and a twelve pack of beer.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryce says that </span><b>he tried to pay Garza with the beer and the $50</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Garza demanded $100 for the work he had done. Bryce claims that he told Garza that he only had $50 with him and Garza allegedly responded by saying, "Hang on," and then walking back to the kitchen to get something. When he returned, Bryce says that </span><b>he had a knife concealed behind his back "like a snake."</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Garza is alleged to have swung as soon as he came within range, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stabbing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the knife into Bryce's back.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Byce claims that he </span><b>pulled the knife out of his back while it was still in Garza's hand</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "He still had control of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the knife</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or at least he thought he did. I never laid a single finger on that man. When he stabbed me with a knife, he totally took it upon himself to stab me in the back. I did not touch him." he told the Bay County District Court during the preliminary examination.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Garza then allegedly lashed out at Bryce again with the knife, this time </span><b>slashing his ear in half.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The two then grappled and fell to the ground, where </span><b>Bryce wrestled the knife away from Garza</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before running away. When asked by the defense attorney why he had chosen to engage with Garza instead of leaving, Bryce asked, "So I just stand there and let him keep stabbing me? Is that what people do?" </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryce was hospitalized at St. Mary's of Michigan Hospital in Standish, MI after first driving to his brother's home. He was released from the hospital after about one and half days. Garza was arrested and </span><b>charged with a single counts of Assault With Intent to Cause Great Bodily Harm Less Than Murder, and </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><b>Assault With a Dangerous Weapon</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The first charge is a 10 year felony, and the second count is also a felony punishable by up to 4 years in prison. </span>

&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Garza appeared for his first day of trial before Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill on Tuesday, October 4. Barring a last minute plea deal Garza's trial will continue this week.
