  A Michigan woman was sentenced Thursday
  her second wave of cocaine-related
  charges, resulting in added jail time to
  the sentence she is currently serving.
  These cases are always disheartening,
  particuarly as many repeat offenders of
  non-violent drug crimes are also addicts
  that desperately need rehabiltiation,
  not incarceration.

If caught with illicit narcotics by law enforcement officials, it is likely that significant jail time can ensure, even though the criminal act is non-violent. Additionally, the experience of a Michigan criminal defense lawyer shows that those engaged in any drug trade are often also deeply addicted to the substances they handle--needing rehabilitation, not prison time. Putting an addicted drug user in jail will not help better that individual, but instead avoid the real problem: curing the addiction that pushed them towards possession and distribution in the first place. These are the exact circumstances found in the recent story of a former Michigan woman, recently of cocaine-related charges for the second time.

<h2>She purchased large amounts of cocaine to feed her addiction</h2>
According to court documents, Sheri Piekarski, 42, began buying cocaine from a dealer in mid-2006, acquiring large amounts to redistribute to others and feed her vicious addiction. By the end of 2008, the woman also known as "White Sheri," sold four pounds of cocaine, worth approximately $60,000. However, she was discovered by law enforcement officials after two of her sales were to police informants. It is believed that Piekarski is a part of a much larger drug ring, that allegedly have distributed 44 pounds of Cocaine throughout the Sheboygan area--so far, seven people including Piekarski have been convicted.

When the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html">Michigan cocaine charges </a>were presented, Piekarski was already serving a sentence stemming from 2007, also on cocaine-related convictions. Even though the original punishment was to keep her behind bars until June 2011, following her admission of guilt, the judge extended her jail sentence two months. Although the maximum penalty for conspiracy to deliver cocaine is 25 years in prison, any sort of incarceration is disheartening. Especially as the judge admitted he took her character into great consideration: before developing an extreme cocaine addiction, Piekarski built a life on being a loving wife and mother, as well as a successful engineer. Additionally, the judge recognized that her each violation on her criminal record is linked to that addiction. It seems that reason would point towards intensive rehab, not an increase in rehabilitation.

Being accused of Michigan drug charges is a difficult process for anyone to go through, regardless of how many prior violations on their record. As seen by the example of Sheri Piekarski, conviction of these crimes, particularly as a repeat offender, can result in extended or intensified punishments, such as increased jail time. Such a situation is particularly disheartening, as it seems moot to put an addicted person in a confined area with several addicts and violent offenders--such a system could potentially decrease the convict's chance of successfully reintegrating into society after release, instead of providing the opportunity to get sober.
