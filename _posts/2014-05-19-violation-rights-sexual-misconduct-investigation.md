<h2>Student Files Lawsuit Against University Of Michigan</h2>
A University of Michigan student is suing U of M over allegations that the university violated his rights in a sexual misconduct investigation. Drew Sterrett, 21, alleges he was suspended from school over rape charges that he says arose from consensual sex. He was never criminally charged. Sterrett says that while he was home for the summer, the University of Michigan Office of Conflict Resolution contacted him August 6, 2012, regarding a student complaint against him. On that same day, Sterrett participated in a Skype interview with the school regarding the complaint. According to Sterrett, he was not told what the allegations were against him.

On January 13, 2013, the University of Michigan gave Sterrett a “resolution agreement” asking him to agree to be suspended from school until May 1, 2016. Sterrett did not sign the agreement, because he did not believe there had been any sexual misconduct on his part. On February 1, 2013, a U of M administrator upheld the findings of the investigator and suspended Sterrett from school.

The interesting thing to note about this case is even if you are not formally charged with a crime, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html" target="_blank">simply being accused of one</a> can result in serious consequences. Sterrett was an engineering student and, by all accounts, doing very well. After being accused of sexual misconduct, his educational goals have been delayed, possibly for years. False allegations can derail careers and reputations. The Kronzek Firm attorneys have seen this first hand. If you are accused of a crime, talk to an attorney. You do have rights.

In May 2013, Sterrett appealed the suspension to a University of Michigan appeals board. Although Sterrett submitted witness affidavits contradicting the findings, the board denied the appeal. On April 23, 2014, Sterrett filed his <a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C422124157.PDF" target="_blank">lawsuit</a>. He is suing for damages and asking to be reinstated and allowed to return to U of M.
