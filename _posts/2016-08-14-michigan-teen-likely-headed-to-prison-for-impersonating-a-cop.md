<h2>Teen With "Dark Thoughts" Impersonates Undercover Police Officer to Get Closer To Waitress</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">18-year-old Nicholas M. Fuhst from Otsego County has been accused of having what the prosecutor described as "</span><b>some dark thoughts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." This led to a felony charge that he just pled no contest to. 'No contest' doesn't mean admitting that you're guilty, but in the eyes of the court it's treated just like a guilty plea.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Assistant Prosecutor Joseph Albosta, on May 12th 2016, Fuhst arrived at a Hooters restaurant in Kochville Township, and </span><b>told some of the waitresses that he was an undercover cop</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He asked to see a list of all of the restaurant's employees and then after viewing the list, asked for more information about certain employees.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those waitresses were skeptical about Fuhst's claim to be an undercover </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> officer and they called the local police in Saginaw County, MI. Officers arrived at the scene and questioned Fuhst. He admitted that he was hoping to find out more about the Hooters waitresses in order to friend them on Facebook. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The items officers found with him at the time led officers to doubt the truth in his claim. Police found that Fuhst had </span><b>three knives, lighter fluid, and some zip ties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with him when he went to Hooters that day. Combined with the list of employees on which he had already circled several names, officers believed that Fuhst had more than Facebook on his mind. They believe he had serious ulterior motives.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuhst was arrested and charged with Impersonating a Peace Officer to Commit a Crime. That’s    a felony under Michigan law and is punishable by up to four years in prison. However, due to the fact that Fust has an existing criminal record, he is being </span><b>charged as a habitual offender</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That will enhance his possible sentence. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Michigan Department of Corrections, Fuhst is listed as a probation absconder. He is currently serving two years of probation for a number of unrelated crimes including </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-arson-attorney.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">malicious destruction of personal property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That means that Fuhst can have his probation revoked, be sentenced on his earlier crime and then be sentenced for his new impersonating crime. The criminal defense attorneys at the Kronzek Firm says that the judge, under Michigan law, can require that any sentences be served consecutively rather than concurrently. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Fuhst also pled no contest to a misdemeanor count of disturbing workers which carries a 90-day maximum penalty, and to a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charge of violating his probation by absconding. Fuhst entered his no contest pleas before Saginaw County Chief Circuit Judge Fred L. Borchard. He will be sentenced  on September 8th.</span>
