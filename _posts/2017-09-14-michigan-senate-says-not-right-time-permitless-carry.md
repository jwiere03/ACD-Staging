And that isn't likely to change any time soon.[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who follow our blog, you'll remember </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-laws-michigan-new-possible-changes-know-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an article we posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few months ago about possible changes coming down the pipeline with regard to gun laws in Michigan. Among other things, there was a bill that had been introduced which, if signed into law, would allow Michigan residents to </span><b>carry concealed firearms without a permi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">t.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Michigan law, no one is allowed to purchase, carry, possess, or transport a handgun in Michigan without first getting a license for it, a process which is regulated</span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,4643,7-123-1878_1591_3503_4654-10929--,00.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Michigan State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. State Representative Lee Chatfield, however, thinks that </span><b>this is a waste of taxpayer resources</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as it does nothing to reduce crime, but costs the state a lot of money and manpower.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is something of a controversial concept that has stirred up a great deal of debate since it's introduction. State Rep Chatfield, the man behind the proposal, aims to </span><b>eliminate the required registration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for gun owners in Michigan. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives in June, and looked as it it may be a done deal. But the Michigan Senate, it seems, doesn't agree.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof was open about his perspective that the time simply isn't right for permitless </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun carrying in Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His reasons? Well, although the Senator admits that he hasn't discussed these particular bills with Governor Snyder, he senses that </span><b>the Governor is reluctant to change Michigan gun laws at this time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "The timing isnâ€™t right yet, maybe is the right way to say it." he explained.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Michigan is unlikely to end up a 'permit-free' state after all.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meekhof, who currently chairs the Senate Government Operations committee where House Bills 4416-4419 are being reviewed, believes the bills might have a better chance if they were part of a different deal. But not now. Perhaps some time in the future. Interestingly, </span><b>Governor Snyder hasn't made a decision yet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and his spokesperson Anna Heaton says that if the bills were to end up on his desk he would be willing to review them.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should Meekhof be wrong, and the Senate does choose to vote the bills through, it would mean significant changes for Michigan gun laws. Specifically, the four bill package would repeal the requirement that Michigan gun owners get a permit in order to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carry a concealed firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Penalties for certain violations, like carrying a handgun without proper identification, would be reduced. However, </span><b>people prohibited from having or owning guns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the current law would still be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felon-possession-firearm-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forbidden from carrying them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, some of those people can have their gun rights restored, according to Attorney Stephanie M. Service at The Kronzek Firm.</span>

&nbsp;
