Breaking up is never easy and revenge may be sweet, but going too far can land anyone in serious trouble. Any violent act towards another person, particularly previous significant others, can warrant arrest and even result in jail time. Experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers see a variety of cases involving ex-lovers, however a recent case highlighted in the news was a first: a man was arrested near Cadillac after being accused of setting his ex-girlfriend on fire.

According to law enforcement officials, on April 30th, Charles Jones, 49, approached his ex-girlfriend, 51, in her driveway as she returned home from work. He allegedly proceeded to spray her in an unidentified flammable substance and then attempted to light her on fire. She immediately jumped to the ground to dismantle the flames, and also had the assistance of neighbors. However, before police could catch up with Jones, he had already fled the scene.

<h2>Police find and arrest Basar on various charges</h2>

The Howell Police Department immediately put out a bulletin alerting other officers to arrest Jones. According to Police Chief George Basar, it was just a matter of time before he was discovered. "We knew he was in the Cadillac area. It was just a matter of flushing him out," Baser explained. While driving down M-115, a Wexford County Sheriff's Deputy noticed Jones' car and pulled him over immediately.Â  After arresting him without any altercations, police took him to the Livingston County Jail. Prosecutors charge him with a count of stalking, torture, and attempted murder--also taking his criminal history for assaulting ex-girlfriends into consideration.

As seen by the example of Charles Jones, being suspected of criminal charges can have significant consequences. Each of the counts held against Jones will result in the loss of many enjoyed personal liberties including jail time.
