Body cameras worn by police officers is an issue with lots of debate between those who argue that transparency and accountability are great tools for ensuring better officer conduct, and those who claim that the financial investment is too great a strain for most departments to make it a worthwhile expenditure.<!--more-->

However, it has recently been decided that a small group of officers in one of the Detroit-area police precincts will be equipped with body cameras as part of a 90-day-trial. Authorities are hoping that by allowing all police-civilian interactions to be recorded and reviewed, greater transparency will be achieved. As a result, police relations with the public will then be seen in a more positive light.

<h2>More departments are considering body cameras</h2>

In the wake of the recent rash of police brutality accusations around the country, more and more departments are considering body cameras. Even the president has weighed in on the issue and has spoken several times in promotion of the idea.

The 90-day-trial in Detroit will apparently be conducted using 415 cameras created by three separate companies. This is an effort to determine which system is most compatible with the police department needs. Each of the three varieties will be worn for 30 days. This will presumably allow them to compare the results and then make suggestions to other Michigan-based police departments who may take this step in the future.

But the trial run in Detroit isn't the only way in which this idea is being pursued here in Michigan. State Representative Rose Mary Robinson and a number of her colleagues are talking about introducing legislation that requires all Michigan officers to wear body cameras.

Many people it seems are in favor of this idea; both for the safety of the police and the safety of the public. According to Senator Bert Johnson, the use of body cameras by police has been shown to reduce instances of brutality. Senator Rick Jones agrees, claiming that cameras will exonerate officers accused of not doing their jobs properly.

But realistically, Michigan can hardly afford to equip every officer with a body camera. The technology isn't cheap. And as it turns out, the storage of the data costs even more. But it is certainly a step in the right direction. Because of Ferguson and other similar incidents, the relationship between police officers and the public they serve is very strained. It could use all the help it can get. What do you think?
