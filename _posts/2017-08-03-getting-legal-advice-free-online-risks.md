Are you getting what you paid for?[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet is like a carnival. There's some great stuff available, but there's also a great deal of garbage you have to wade through in order to find what you want. And even then… is it really what you wanted? Sometimes it's hard to be sure, especially when </span><b>everything is packaged specifically to entice you and draw you in</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (After all, your "clicks" are worth money to someone.) So when it comes to free advice online, are you getting the real deal? Or are you simply getting what you paid for?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious about what might be involved in </span><a href="https://www.midmichigandivorce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting divorced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Then we encourage you to search online and learn all you can about ending a marriage. Want </span><b>a better understanding</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of what alimony is, or why </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/court-appointed-attorneys-often-not-good-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public defenders might not be your best choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a criminal case when selecting an attorney, feel free to surf the net. You’ll get some fact and you’ll get some fiction. The problem is that it’s hard to tell one from the other sometimes. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you're actually getting divorced, a website probably isn't the right place to get your info about what documents to file, which court to petition, and who to serve subpoenas to. Your ex slashed your tires and you decided to get revenge by posting nude pictures of them on Craigslist as a fake escort ad? Well, </span><b>the internet isn't going to defend you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against a </span><a href="https://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/revenge-porn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revenge porn charge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or ensure that you're properly represented during your criminal case. Being investigated for fraud? Well, reading about fraud online may help you understand what you're accused of, but it won't help you construct a strong defense and ensure that your rights are protected.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Q &amp; A websites where people submit questions and then read the different responses submitted by attorneys are a great way to gather information, but it's </span><b>a terrible way to make guided legal decisions!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Why? Well, if you've ever been to one of those websites and read through the submissions and responses, then you know what we're talking about.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Free legal advice websites can be helpful, but not always. So be careful!</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's say John Doe in Detroit, Michigan has been talked to by police about a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they suspect he might be connected to. </span><b>He's scared of being arrested</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and doesn't know what to do next. So he goes online and submits a question to a free legal Q&amp;A site, and waits for an answer. After all, it's just like having an attorney, right? Only better, because it's free!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Mr. Doe gets four answers. He's thrilled. But in reading them, he realizes that they all have slightly different opinions to offer. He's confused. Which one is correct? The criminal defense attorney from New York? Or what about the one from Texas? Nope, </span><b>neither is going to help him because Michigan law is different</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from laws and penal codes in other states. So obviously he should go with the two remaining attorneys from Michigan, right?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nope again! Since one is a local attorney whose practice centers around wills and estates, they aren't likely to give him </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the best advice he needs in a criminal case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  And the other one? He's also Michigan-based, which is great… but he's a divorce lawyer, so that's a no-go. Back to square one. Except John </span><b>may not have noticed where the criminal attorney who advised him came from</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or even if he did, he may not have realized that the two Michigan lawyers weren't criminal defense attorneys. Or if he realized all that, he won’t know which lawyer is a top level criminal defense attorney and which lawyer might be at the bottom of the barrel. Either way, none of the answers will help him, but he may not realize that until it's too late!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now don't misunderstand… we're not suggesting that you should give up online research, or that you shouldn't search for information that's pertinent to your case. What we are suggesting however, is that you </span><b>realize the limits of free online advice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because it is limited. Very limited. And while a tax attorney in Massachusetts, or a medical malpractice lawyer in Arizona can certainly advise you all day long online, neither can help you in any way if you are in actual need of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/about-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal help here in Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So as </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced criminal defense attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we would like to give you some free online advice. Here goes: </span><b>Don't rely on free online advice to solve your legal dilemmas!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Look things up, learn about the law, ask questions….. But if you have a real legal problem, or are under investigation in Michigan, have been accused of a crime, or suspect that law enforcement may come knocking, call The Kronzek Firm immediately at 866 766 5245. We are here to help you. Actual help. The kind you can really use.</span>
