<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again. In our previous article, we discussed how to determine whether or not </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/about-us.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you need an attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and whether or not you are facing state or federal charges. Next we're going to be looking at </span><b>things you need to take into account when selecting a Michigan criminal defense attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like an attorney's educational background, research, and qualities.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Determine what is most important to you</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, </span><b>the MOST important thing is having the best possible outcome</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That goes without saying. However, beyond that, there are usually a few things that can "make or break" a professional working relationship, and you need to know what they are ahead to time.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding before you start looking for the right criminal defense attorney what the qualities are that you most want in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your legal representative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will </span><b>help you to eliminate attorneys that you would have a hard time working with</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That will make your situation less stressful and unpleasant than it already is. A good working relationship with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is so important, because you are going to spend a good deal of time dealing with them, and so it's critical that you are able to trust them. Premium level criminal lawyers in Michigan consider their clients to be a key member of the defense team. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonly, people look for qualities like </span><b>being a good listener, a willingness to hear out the client when they have concerns and patience when explaining complex legal issues or answering questions about the case</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These can make your case run more smoothly and reduce time wasted on unnecessary things like arguing. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Do your homework</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have chosen an attorney you would like to work with, take a little time to do your homework. </span><b>Anyone can look good on their own website, but is there any other information available to </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html" target="_blank"><b>back up their claims</b></a><b>?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What </span><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=kronzek%20and%20cronkright%20reviews&amp;lrd=0x8822c006fbd86c07:0x3235490652c45c29,1," target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were left for them by others who hired them in the past? Which national, statewide and local media outlets have covered this lawyer? </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at the professional memberships and legal organizations they belong to. </span><b>A practicing Michigan attorney must belong to the </b><a href="https://www.michbar.org/" target="_blank"><b>State Bar of Michigan</b></a><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A lawyer who belongs to the </span><a href="https://www.nacdl.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NACDL) or the </span><a href="https://cdam.wildapricot.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CDAM) are other good indicators that the attorney in question is serious about their practice.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Where were they educated?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another indicator of a good attorney is a good education. Find out where your attorney of choice went to get their law degree, and what degree they hold. </span><b>Having a Juris Doctorate, also called a Juris Doctor, from a reputable law school goes a long way,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially if the attorney graduated cum laude (which means "with honors" in Latin). However, this should not be among the major factors that sways you one way or the other. Top criminal defense attorneys agree that learning how to defendant against criminal charges really begins after law school ends. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This information should be available on every </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attorney's web page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with information about where they are legally permitted to practice law. </span><b>Pay attention to a lawyer’s scope of practice.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While an attorney who can practice law here in a </span><a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can do a great job, an attorney who can practice law in both federal and state courts may have more experience and a history of handling more complex cases. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The importance of a meeting</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most attorneys offer a free consultation, which allows you to meet with them before deciding to hire them. </span><b>Always make use of this free consultation as an opportunity to learn more about your case, and to determine whether or not your attorney is a good fit for you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pay attention to communication skills, as these will be crucial during this process.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure that you choose the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best possible criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to represent your interest in a criminal case can make a huge difference in how your case turns out. </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#4" target="_blank"><b>A skilled attorney</b></a><b> can mean the difference between a dismissal and 20 years in prison.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When choosing an attorney to represent you, make sure that you select someone skilled and aggressive, with experience in the area that you will be needing help.  </span>
