<h2><b>How to Choose the Right Michigan Defense Attorney When You Need One </b></h2>
<h3><b>Do you need an attorney?</b></h3>
If you got a speeding ticket, or lost control of your car on an icy road and bumped into a street sign, but didn't stick around or call the police to report the accident, you will likely be cited for leaving the scene of an accident. While both of these count as breaking the law, you aren't likely to need an attorney to represent you in court. But if you have been charged with a crime, and we mean the kind of crime that will result in possible jail or prison time, chances are you're going to need an attorney. And quick!<!--more-->
<h3><b>So, what kind of attorney do you need?</b></h3>
If you have been accused of a crime, you need a defense attorney, but that doesn't mean you should just call up the first attorney that pops up when you do an online search. There are a couple of things you need know in order to narrow down your search.
<h3><b>Are the charges state or federal charges?</b></h3>
This makes a difference. If the law you are accused of breaking was a state law, you will need an attorney who can legally practice law in the state of Michigan. However, if you have been accused of a federal crime you will need an attorney who can defend you in federal court.

This can seem very confusing, and we understand that. But the kind of charges you are facing are usually a good indicator of whether they originated on a federal or state level. For example, tax fraud, money laundering, and civil rights violations are federal, while most criminal matters are addressed by local law.

The thing to remember here is that when you are charged with a federal crime, you are being prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s office, as opposed to charges that are brought on a state level by the prosecuting attorney of a local county.

Another important point to remember is that when facing federal charges you will be prosecuted by an attorney who has far more time and resources at hand and therefore, the case may be more complex and more time consuming. So be sure to select a seasoned, well-respected attorney with experience and success in federal defenses.
<h3><b>Choose an attorney who can defend you properly</b></h3>
All defense attorneys practicing in the state of Michigan can defend you against pretty much any charge, from drunk driving to child abuse, but not all of them are going to give you the best possible defense. Why? Because attorneys tend to specialize their practices in certain areas, and choosing an attorney with no experience in handling the charges you are facing could mean a less-than-ideal defense.

As an example, at our firm we have a number of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys" target="_blank">attorneys on staff</a>. While all of them are very capable and very experienced, several of them specialize in particular areas of law, like sex crime defense, CPS defense and even family law. For this reason, we are able to meet every client’s needs by working together as a team, allowing those with more experience in certain areas to lead and guide a defense to ensure the best possible outcome.
