<p dir="ltr">Aubrey Ann Coy, a 34 year old resident of Kosciusko County in Indiana, is facing 7 felony charges and 1 misdemeanor following a high speed police chase that took place in Southern Michigan recently.</p>
Apparently Coy and her mother were visiting Coy's 5 year old daughter, a supervised visit for which Coy's mother was appointed the supervisor. During the visit, Coy took her daughter and her mother's car and fled. Coy's mother called 911 as soon as she realised that her daughter and the child were missing.
<h2>Her Criminal History Was Familiar To County Law Enforcement</h2>
Coy is well known to authorities in her county. She has an extensive criminal history including felony charges for theft, forgery, fraud, resisting law enforcement, possession of methamphetamine, leaving the scene of an accident, operating while intoxicated (drunk driving) and possession of a controlled substance. She has also been previously charged with misdemeanors for trespassing, intimidation and operating while intoxicated.

By using the GPS in her cell phone, Kosciusko County Sheriff Department tracked Coy to her location in Michigan and alerted the St. Joseph County Dispatch that she was entering their jurisdictiona. At this point the Michigan State Police began the search for her car.

A trooper noticed her vehicle in Mottville Township and approached the car. Apparently the 5 year old was sitting in the front seat without a car seat or restraints.  The officer spoke with her briefly, but when he asked her to step out of the car, Coy drove away at high speed. MSP chased her for several miles, during which time the child was seen climbing into her lap in the driver's seat.  The chase reached 75 miles per hour.

Police were finally able to pull the vehicle over when one of Coy's tires came off of the rim and two other tires were flattened by stop sticks. At this point Coy grabbed the child and attempted to flee on foot. She was quickly overtaken by police and tried to fight them off before being taken into custody. Officers found cocaine during a search of the vehicle after the arrest. The child is safe and has been returned to family.

Coy has been charged with felony counts of second-degree child abuse, obstruction of justice, possession of cocaine, fleeing and eluding police and three counts of resisting arrest. Coy was also charged with a misdemeanor count of operating under the influence of a narcotic. Authorities have said that it is likely that she may face additional charges in Kosciusko county, which may include interfering with child custody and/or kidnapping.
