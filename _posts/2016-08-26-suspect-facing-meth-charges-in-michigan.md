<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddy Randal Parker, a 36-year-old resident of Fairfield, Ohio, was recently arrested in Kalamazoo Township for allegedly trying to deliver a large quantity of methamphetamines to a house in the Kalamazoo County. It seems that police were aware of Parker's reason for being in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/kalamazoo-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalamazoo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because Â </span><b>an informant had tipped them off that he intended to deliver a large quantity of meth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from California to someone in the Kalamazoo area.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Michigan reveals that investigators from the Kalamazoo Valley Enforcement Team (KVET) </span><b>kept Parker's motel room under constant surveillance after they received the tip</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They tracked him from the Baymont Inn in Oshtemo Township all the way to a house on Gayle Street, where they arrested him.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Police officers discovered 5.5 pounds of methamphetamines</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A search of his person revealed </span><b>a loaded .357 magnum revolver</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Parker had stuck into the waistband of his pants. In addition, police officers discovered </span><b>5.5 pounds of methamphetamines</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his vehicle along with two other guns, a digital scale, and $5,000 cash. The street value of that much </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is estimated to be about $300,000. Parker is a convicted felon. That means that </span><b>both state and federal law prohibit him from owning or possessing a gun</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After his arrest, law enforcement returned to Parker's motel room and searched that as well. There were allegedly two people waiting in Parker's motel room, both of whom admitted to having travelled to Michigan with Parker from Ohio. The search revealed </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crack cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, crystal meth, and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Police also </span><b>seized cellphones which contained text messages that officers believe were to do with the delivery of drugs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After his arrest, officers interviewed Parker. He allegedly admitted to having both the meth and the guns. He also is said to have told police during the interview that </span><b>he had recently been in Kentucky where he also delivered a large quantity of meth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to someone.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators with KVET also worked with law enforcement in Ohio where Parker owns a home. A search warrant was obtained for his house in question and the subsequent search revealed more crystal meth, additional guns, and a substantial amount of money. Parker's extensive criminal history, coupled with the large quantities of drugs in this case, means that Parker is headed for a very serious battle in Federal Court.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Kalamazoo County Prosecutor's Office, </span><b>Parker was arraigned in the Kalamazoo County District Court on numerous felony charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These charges include </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery of methamphetamine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felon in possession of a firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felony firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Carrying a concealed weapon. His bail was set at $2 million cash or surety.</span>
