<span style="font-weight: 400;">You've probably heard at least something about the influx of 'creepy clowns' we've been having lately. Social media and the news are full of sightings, with <strong>numerous people around the U.S. claiming to have seen sinister clown activity</strong>. Some have actually claimed to have been been threatened. But is this a real concern? </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One man in Livonia, New York was recently arrested after </span><b>posting a photo-shopped image of a clown sitting alone in a park swing after dark to his Facebook wall</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The response, given the number of other </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/defenses-to-crimes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creepy clown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relates issues currently circulating, was sweeping paranoia. A number of people called Hooper out on Facebook, pointing out the image was obviously photoshopped and that it was </span><b>not kind or smart to cause mass panic for no reason</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">New York's Livonia County Sheriff's Office obviously agreed. Hooper </span><b>was arrested and has been charged with Falsely Reporting an Incident</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Had this taken place in Michigan, this charge would have been a misdemeanor in this case, punishable by up to 93 days in jail and fines of up to $500. But it didn't happen in Michigan. So are we in the clear?</span>

&nbsp;
<h3>Michigan has had 'creepy clown' reports in more than 20 places</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears not. Although </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/oakland-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-expert-lawyer-pontiac-farmington-novi-southfield.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auburn Hills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Police Chief Doreen Olko says in her blog that there have been no confirmed sightings of creepy clowns in Auburn Hills, and Lansing hasn't had a single report of a creepy clown sighting, Michigan is far from untouched. Thus far, according to several media sources, </span><b>there have been reports of creepy clown activity in over twenty Michigan cities and towns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So where exactly have clowns been sighted here in the Great Lakes state in the last six weeks? Big Rapids, Flint, Jackson, Mount Pleasant and Sterling Height, to name but a few. Additionally, there are </span><b>reports of two separate </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank"><b>armed robberies</b></a><b> that took place in Ann Arbor just a few days ago involving a man in a clown mask</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The robber, wearing a clown mask, is said to have pulled a gun and demanded money, before fleeing with the spoils.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><b>armed clown robbed a Walgreens in Brownstown Township</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Sterling Heights, a </span><b>clown allegedly </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><b>cut a young boy's arm</b></a><b> with a butter knife</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, minutes before two women were chased by clowns </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wielding baseball bats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an unrelated incident. The majority of the sightings and encounters, however, are harmless. Creepy certainly, but harmless.</span>
<h3></h3>
&nbsp;
<h3>What's up with all the creepy clowns, all of a sudden?</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Benjamin Radford, author of the non-fiction book </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Clowns-Benjamin-Radford/dp/0826356664" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad Clowns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this phenomena is nothing new.</span><b> A similar creepy clown phase happened in the 80s</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and spread like wildfire before fizzling out , only to be replaced by the next unfounded fad. Radford points to the 'Satanic panic' than also happened in the 80s, along with the outcry about Dungeons and Dragons. All in all, he says, not a cause for concern.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all of that aside, police departments around Michigan are posting and tweeting about the clown sightings, letting their followers know that they are aware and are paying close attention. So on that note, we would like to remind our readers that </span><b>making up creepy clown stories may actually result in </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank"><b>criminal charges</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So while it may sound like fun to get in on the pranking while it's hot, be careful about what you choose to say and do. Also, don't believe everything you hear and see and read. (Unless of course you read it here!)</span>
