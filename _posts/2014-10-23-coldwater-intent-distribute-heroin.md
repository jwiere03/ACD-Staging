23-year-old Bradley Watkins and 41-year-old Jessica Wright, both residents of Coldwater, are charged with having a substantial amount of heroin in their possession, which they apparently intended to sell.

Michigan State Police Trooper Matt Hart claims that he had pulled Watkins over on a traffic violation back in March in Union Township. At the time, Watkins attempted to give the officer a false name, but was caught and arrested for resisting an officer in his duty.<!--more-->

Following that arrest, Watkins was searched and discovered to have Xanax in his pocket for which he didn't have a prescription. This led to a second charge for possession. Hart was issued the warrant for Watkins arrest on that second charge. He was then provided with a tip that Watkins would be found at an apartment on Cutter Avenue. Watkins and Wright were apparently staying there together.


<h2>Officers discovered a syringe used to administer heroin</h2>

However, when Hart arrived at the apartment to arrest Watkins, he apparently fled the scene by way of a window. Officers then searched the property, and during the subsequent search, discovered a syringe used to administer heroin, an unnamed prescription drug along with hydrocodone under the bed, and 123 packets of heroin which were discovered in a nightstand next to the bed.

Wright allegedly told the officers that the drugs and paraphernalia belonged to Watkins, but when he was apprehended by officers four days later, he denied having had anything to do with the heroin or any other illegal items discovered during the search.

Both Wright and Watkins were charged with possession, and possession with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank">intent to distribute heroin</a>. Â Heroin is a schedule 1 drug under Michigan law. Because both Wright and Watkins have prior drug related misdemeanor convictions, the penalties for these convictions would be doubled to eight and forty years respectively.

In addition, Watkins was charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">fleeing and eluding police</a>, and Wright was charged with possession of the two prescription drugs. Police say that warrants have been issued for the arrest of two other individuals who were in the apartment at the time as well.

Watkins and Wright are both being held at the Branch County Jail on bonds of $75,000. Their preliminary exams have not yet been scheduled.
