<span style="font-weight: 400;">29-year-old Josh Salyers has been accused of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murdering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his 22-year-old girlfriend, Barbie Dailey. Dailey in Muskegon. Dailey is, </span><b>a mother of three young children and was found dead inside her house</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sunday night, September 4th.</span>
<h2>A Plea of Desperation to Her Father</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Kevin Dailey, the victim's father, the </span><b>last contact he had with his daughter was a desperate conversation where she begged him for help</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She said she needed help getting Salyers out of her father's home where he was staying until he was able to find another place to live. Dailey no longer lived with him after they broke up, having moved out about a week before.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Dailey had maintained a good relationship with the father of her oldest daughter, it was his mother she moved in with while Salyers looked for alternate housing. Â According to Dailey's father, on that final day</span><b> she was hysterical and screaming, begging him to help her</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get rid of Salyers and claiming that she didn't love him any more. All the while, Salyers was allegedly texting her repeatedly. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police say that they were first contacted by Salyers. He told them that Dailey had called him seeking help after being </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and that he found her injured in her house. </span><b>Her throat had been slashed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and she was bleeding out. First responders rushed Dailey to the hospital in Muskegon where she received emergency treatment for her wounds. But it was too late. She died </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Salyers first told officers that </span><b>Dailey had been attacked by someone else and he had come to her rescue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, police did not believe him. A neighbor's security camera captured footage of him entering the house with Dailey and then running down a nearby alley shortly afterwards. When police told him that they had footage of his getaway attempt, </span><b>he confessed to slashing her throat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dailey's family members say that Salyers seemed like a good boyfriend at first, but became more and more </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controlling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with time. He is alleged to have controlled a good deal of Dailey's life, </span><b>telling her what to wear, forcing her to quit her job and dictating who she could talk to</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Friends and family say that they were concerned with these classic symptoms of domestic violence. .</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A warrant was issued by the Muskegon County Prosecutor's office the following day. Salyers was arrested and charged with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He appeared by video feed for his arraignment in the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/muskegon.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muskegon County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District Court, </span><b>wearing a suicide prevention vest and weeping</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the charges were read out by the judge.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Raymond Kostrzewa denied Salyers bond at the request of Muskegon County Prosecutor's Chief Trial Attorney Matt J. Roberts. According to Roberts, </span><b>Salyers has admitted to the murder</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and should not be allowed out of jail. His preliminary examination is scheduled for Tuesday, September 20, 2016 at 9:30 am. He is facing life without parole in prison. </span>
