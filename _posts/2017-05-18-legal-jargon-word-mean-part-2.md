Not knowing what's going on isn't awesome. Here's the solution...[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here it is! The next installment in our Legal Jargon series! (Hey Michigan, you know you've been waiting for it.) Because nothing is more annoying than eating your body weight in popcorn and watching six consecutive episodes of </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275140/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law and Order: Criminal Intent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and having </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no idea what's going on</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span><b>We've had to explain many legal terms over the years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clients, friends and even total strangers. So we figured we'd save you the hassle of having to hunt down an attorney, and just make a list for you here.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Missed the first installment? No big deal, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/legal-jargon-word-mean-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can catch up here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for those of you all caught up and raring to go (</span><b>remember 'mens rea' and 'habeas corpus'?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">)...let's pick up where we left off last time.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Amicus Curiae:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This rather strange sounding term means "friend of the court," although in this case, it isn't the same thing as the Friend of the Court (which is in fact a completely different entity.) In this case, amicus curiae refers to </span><b>someone who is not a party to the litigation, but who believes that the court's decision may affect its interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, an individual, organization or business that isn't directly involved in the legal proceeding, but </span><b>who the court allows to weigh in</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about some matter of law that directly affects the case in question. Sometimes appellate courts will allow an organization, person or business to file an 'amicus brief' with the court to make their position known to the court. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Completely unrelated to amicus curiae, is the </span><a href="http://oaklandcountyfamilylaw.com/friend-of-the-court-information.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friend of the Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is an entity that works hand-in-hand with the family court. Its job is to </span><b>investigate disputes and make recommendations to the circuit court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concerning issues like child custody and support, parenting time, and medical support. It is also in charge of enforcing family court support/custody/parenting time orders.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>De Facto:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have actually heard this term used outside the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">courtroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or the studio-made-to-look-like-a-courtroom, as it were). Why? </span><b>Because it isn't specifically a legal term</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although it's sometimes used in court. De facto is a Latin term that means "in fact" or "actually." It refers to a rule that people follow, even though it is not an official legal procedure or law.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, while Michigan law doesn't recognize common law marriage, a couple who never married </span><b>may still consider their thirty-year relationship to be a de facto marriage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the same way, racial segregation in the 50s and 60s in America was de facto segregation, not segregation enforced by law. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>De Jure:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup, it's another Latin term. (For being a dead language, Latin sure does get around, doesn't it!) And no, it has nothing to do with 'soup du jour', which means soup of the day, not legally authorized soup. </span><b>De jure means "by law"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and refers to something that is authorized by law.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of </span><b>how 'de jure' and 'de facto' could be used together</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would be this one, which was provided by the Washington University School of Law: “I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it’s a de facto swimming pool.”</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>En Banc:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoping for a break from Latin? Here you go, this one's French. It means "on the bench" and refers to </span><b>all the judges of the Appellate Court sitting together to hear a case</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is different from routine dispositions by panels of three judges that normally hear cases in the Michigan Court of Appeals, or another appellate court. When lawyers see an appellate decision en banc, it just means that the entire court decided together on an especially important case. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you check out the website for the </span><a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Court for the Sixth Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which is the Appeals Court that oversees Michigan cases), you will see the term 'en banc' used regularly. For example: "</span><b>The page limit for a petition for en banc hearing (or panel rehearing) is 15 pages</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span>

&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope this brief terminology breakdown was informative. So next time you’re draped across the couch, snarfing Doritos and marathoning endless episodes of </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ally McBeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (whatever, you know you love that show!), at least </span><b>you’ll know what’s really going on during those court scenes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’re welcome.</span>
