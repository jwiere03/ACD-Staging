All Michigan sex crime lawyers can attest: being suspected of a sex crime is a serious accusation with life-changing consequences. Not only could a person face serious legal consequences including jail time, but their reputation will be permanently scarred if forced to register as a sex offender. However, the problems for a suspect will immediately become more serious if the victim in question is a minor, under the age of 18.

According to MyFoxDetroit.com, Dennis Malone, 54, persuaded a 15 year-old girl to run away with him. After the teen's father reported her missing, law enforcement officials tracked down Malone, discovering both him and the girl inside a house in downtown Detroit. At first, the suspect barricaded himself in the house with a firearm, but eventually surrendered to the police, and the young girl was apprehended. As a result of his involvement in this incident, Malone is facing a laundry list of Michigan sex offense charges, including <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html" target="_blank">first degree criminal sexual conduct</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html" target="_blank">failure to register as a sex offender</a>, and possession of an unlawful weapon.


<h2>Not the first time he has been arrested for sex crimes</h2>

Despite these new charges, records show that this is not the first time that Malone has been arrested for Michigan sex crimes. In 1992, he was convicted of seven counts of inappropriate sexual contact with girls younger than 13 years old. Sources disclosed that Malone has a history of targeting young, rebellious girls and persuading them to have sex with him. In most cases, the alleged victims were a quarter of his age. Malone was released in 2004, but could likely face serious legal consequences including more jail time if convicted of the crimes that he is currently accused of.

As seen by the example of Dennis Malone, being accused of sex crimes in Michigan is a difficult experience for anyone to go through, regardless of previous criminal history. A sex crime conviction can have permanent consequences, including loss of job, fines, placement on a public registry, and/or jail time.
