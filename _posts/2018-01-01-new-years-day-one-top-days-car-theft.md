&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So you decided to catch a cab home after a night at the bar? Avoid </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the chances of a DUI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or trashing your vehicle and ending up in jail? Good for you! The problem, however, is that there are people who would take advantage of your desire to stay safe, by </span><b>stealing your car on New Year's Day</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics show that New Year's Day ranks as one of </span><b>the holidays with the most car thefts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the </span><a href="https://www.nicb.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Insurance Crime Bureau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Interestingly, they also revealed that the day with the least number of car thefts was Christmas Day, which only had 1,664 vehicles stolen. So what does that mean for us Michigan residents?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Keep Your Vehicle Safe With These Basic Tips:</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3><b> Don't "hide" a spare key on your vehicle.</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a spare key tucked away in a little magnetic box on the underside of your car is super convenient when you're locked out of your car. But this trick is now so common that many </span><b>thieves check for a spare key</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long before they </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">break a window</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don't make it easy for someone to drive off in your car! </span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Keep your car secured.</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This probably seems like a no-brainer, but you'd be amazed at how many people </span><b>forget to lock their cars or roll up the windows</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nothing makes stealing a vehicle (or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stealing things out of a car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) easier than having it open to the public. So roll up those windows, lock ALL of the doors, and keep the keys where they're safe.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Don't keep valuables in your car.</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your car's purpose is to carry you and your loved ones from point A to point B and back again. It isn't a safe, or a storage bin. So make sure that you use it the way it was meant to be used. Keeping basic items in your car like tissues, children's books, and non-perishable snacks is fine. </span><b>Money, purses, expensive sunglasses, your wallet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, jewelry and any other pricey items should be kept at home, not stored in the car. Especially if they can be seen through the car windows by passers-by! If you insist on using your car to store valuables, lock them in the trunk where they are out of sight of thieves. </span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Don't leave your car running.</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Michigan residents, we understand the temptation to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/motor-vehicle-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leave your car running</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while you finish getting ready inside. It’s so tempting </span><b>when it's freezing cold outside</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! But unless your vehicle has remote start capabilities, which allows it to run with the doors locked and the keys inside the house, it's an invitation to opportunistic thieves. In addition, in most parts of Michigan you can be ticketed for leaving your car running without being in it. </span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Invest in an anti-theft device for your car.</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-theft devices can be pricey. However, if your car cost you a bundle, it may be a worthwhile investment. Because thieves are often looking for something "quick and easy," </span><b>a vehicle with a physical anti-theft device is much less appealing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This includes steering wheel locks, tire locks, vehicle immobilizer systems, kill switches, and vehicle tracking systems. Despite the extra cost, you might get a discount on your car insurance if it has an alarm. Speak with your insurance agent. And by the way, also speak to your insurance agent before you buy a car. They can tell you which cars are surcharged because they are stolen more often or are much more costly to repair. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Michigan Car Theft Laws:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan doesn't have specific laws that deal with stealing cars. Rather, we have general theft laws which includes stealing vehicles. However, stealing items from inside a car is covered under the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/larceny-motor-vehicle-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larceny From a Motor Vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statute. Stealing cars, and stealing from cars, are felonies in Michigan. </span><b>The specific sentence would depend on the value of the vehicle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or items stolen from the vehicle). </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one are accused of stealing a car, or stealing items out of a car, you're going to need the help of an </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
