<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/president-shortens-inmates-prison-sentences.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we discussed the fact that President Obama has dedicated a significant portion of his final year in office to shortening the prison sentences of people primarily convicted of federal nonviolent crimes. Note that the President of the United States can only alter sentences for federal convictions and not for state of Michigan convictions. In this particular case, the man in question is a Detroit-area resident, who says that the opportunity at early freedom has changed his life. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006 Kareem Martin was arrested for </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He later accepted a plea bargain from the United States Attorneyâ€™s office (the federal prosecutor), and pled guilty to Possession with intent to deliver </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2007, Martin was sentenced to serve twenty three years in federal prison. But now, thanks to President Obama, Martin will now get out of prison in 2018, a full 12 years earlier than expected.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&lt;h2&gt;Martin had a long history of criminal conduct&lt;/h2&gt;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of his sentencing in the </span><a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Martin's sentencing guidelines were enhanced due to his previous criminal convictions. Federal Judge Lawrence Zatkoff, who has since passed away, said at the time that Martin had a "long history of criminal conduct" and went on to say that it would be appropriate to grant him a "significant sentence."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin has been pursuing a shorter sentence for years without any luck. In 2014, Martin wrote to Judge Zatkoff explaining that he was a changed man, and had taken the time to better himself in prison by getting an education and becoming an electrician but to no avail. His most recent attempt was rejected on May 13th by Judge Sean Cox, another United States District Court Judge in Detroit.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to clemency statistics provided by the United States Department of Justice, the years between 2009 and 2015 were not particularly active for President Obama went it comes to pardons and commutations granted. But 2016 has been a landmark year, with no less than 348 people receiving clemency grants from this president.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin's sentence was commuted, along with 41 other people's on Friday of last week. According to a press release put out by the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/03/president-obama-grants-commutations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office of the White House Press Secretary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 42 individuals hailed from all over the country, including Florida, Texas, New York and South Carolina. But Martin, originally a resident of River Rouge, Wayne County, Michigan, was the only resident of the Michigan to receive a presidential commutation in this particular group.</span>
