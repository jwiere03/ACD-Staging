Experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers can attest: being convicted of a sex crime can change a person’s life forever.  Not only could the individual be sentenced to jail time, but their reputation will be permanently scarred as a result. For years afterward, a convicted sex offender must register extensive personal information and make frequent in-person appearances. Under the 2006 Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, a convict could acquire additional charges and consequences should they fail to provide truthful and current data, especially after relocating to a new area.

However, a recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, specified the scope of SORNA, and who it applies to. According to the decision handed down, a sex offender cannot be found to have violated SORNA if they were convicted and relocated before the passage of the act and the time it became law.

<h2>Carr appealed this decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed</h2>

A district court originally sentenced Thomas Carr to 30 months behind bars for violating the terms of SORNA, due to a previous conviction of  <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank">sex offense charges</a>. However, Carr appealed this decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed.  In a 6-3 ruling, the high court found that in order for a violation of SORNA to take place, travel from the state of conviction and the failure to report to the new state must both occur after the law was enacted.

As seen by the example of Thomas Carr, an accused sex offender’s troubles continue long after incarceration or probation end.  The result of a sex crimes conviction and violation of SORNA could potentially bring jail time, as well as greatly hindering your reputation and livelihood. Because the consequences of such an experiences are so severe, it is important to contact hard-working and aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank">Michigan sex crimes attorneys</a>.
