According to the Jevons Paradox, when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, the rate of consumption of that resource will rise because demand will increase as a direct result.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular reference comes from the industrial revolution in England.  There, coal-burning factories in the city of Manchester, England, so increased the efficiency of factories during the industrial revolution, that the demand for coal skyrocketed. Which is a classic example of what appears to be happening with Michigan's Concealed Pistol License (CPL) holders.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2004 and 2014, CPLs in Michigan went from 110,777 to 440,006, which is an increase of almost 300 percent. According to statistics provided by Michigan State Police, during that exact same decade, the number of CPL holders who were charged with crimes of any kind on an annual basis, increased from 398 to 4,421. With regard to violent crimes, the increase was almost 600 percent.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern here, it seems, from organizations like the Michigan Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence and even from a number of regular citizens, is that we have a case of Jevons Paradox on our hands. Increasing violence in our society causes more and more people to seek out the safety of being armed for their own defense. But the more people who are armed, the more instances there are of gun-related violence. Which in turn causes more people to buy guns for protection. And round and round it goes….</span>


<h2>Government shouldn’t interfere with citizen’s right to arms</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to the <a href="http://mcrgo.org/" target="_blank">Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners</a>, the government has no place in gun rights. It shouldn't be allowed to interfere with a citizen's right to arm and defend themselves, regardless. Another factor pointed out by those who don't agree with increased regulations controlling gun ownership in Michigan, is that it is unfair to punish the majority for the bad behavior of the minority.</span>

Under current law, applications for CPLs are processed by the MSP and County Clerks, as county gun boards have been eliminated. There are also a host of requirements that CPL applicants must adhere to. For example, a CPL cannot be granted to someone with a felony on their record, or someone who has a personal protection order out against them.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These restrictions should be enough, say supporters of gun freedom. But others disagree, citing the fact that just because someone has no criminal history, doesn't mean they don't have criminal intentions. And people have undiagnosed mental illnesses that could affect the choices they make, once they are armed in public. Both sides have interesting and even valid points. What do you think?</span>
