For many occupations, such as law or medicine, licensure is required before a person is allowed to perform their jobs. Failing to remain licensed and continuing to practice anyway can land anyone in serious trouble, and potentially bring legal consequences against them. Although experienced Michigan criminal defense attorneys always recommend having the appropriate certifications and approval before practicing a profession that can affect others, there are some who neglect to do so. Such an example is seen in recent news as a Holland physician has been arrested after continuing the practice medicine on a suspended license.

In 1995, William Alt of Grandville opened a private office in Holland Township, Michigan. The practice concentrated on internal medicine, with a particular specialization in cardiovascular care. However, in January 2009, Alt's medical license was suspended after a former patient complained that he over-prescribed "habit-forming and potentially addicting medications in excessive amounts." An evaluation of Alt's medical abilities before his hearing found that he "had a poor sense of how to deal with chronic pain and drug seeking behavior," and that he "poorly understood the concept of addiction."
<h2>This is Not the First Time His Licence Has Been At Risk</h2>
However, this is not the first time Alt's license had been at risk--he was also put on probation in 1991 for neglecting to manage appropriately six hospital patients throughout the prior decade. Because he did not contest the allegations, he was placed on probation for a year, required to complete 150 hours of continuing medical training, and pay a fine. Following the completion of this period, Alt moved his practice to Holland.

The Ottawa County Sheriff's Department received a tip in October 2009 suggesting that Alt was still practicing medicine, even though his license was suspended in January. A criminal investigation was conducted spanning several months, that included interviewing patients to obtain proof against him. By mid-April 2010, Alt was charged with unauthorized medical practice, a felony that includes a four-year prison sentence and a substantial fine.

As seen by the example of William Alt, continuing to practice any profession without licensure can have significant consequences, resulting in criminal charges that include significant jail time and/or fines. Conviction can severely limit personal freedoms and liberties, not to mention ruin the social and professional reputation of the person in question. To prevent this from happening, it is essential to be proactive in securing a superior defense for your case.
