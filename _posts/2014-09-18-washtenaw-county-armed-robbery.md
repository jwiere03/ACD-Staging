<h2><b>Police Arrest 3 TeensÂ </b></h2>
While the hazards of being a pizza delivery person are widely known to include verbal harassment and poor if any tips, it isn't common to be robbed at gunpoint while delivering pizza.

However, the police have recently arrested three teenagers suspected of robbing several pizza delivery drivers in what is being called a spree of armed robberies in Washtenaw County over the last few days.<!--more-->

The first armed robbery occurred shortly after 11 pm on September 11th inside the Hamptons of Cloverlane apartment complex. The driver claims that the suspect attempted to rob him at gunpoint, but he fled the area on foot and nothing was stolen.

The second robbery happened just a few hours later at a Motel 6, also in Pittsfield Township, when a delivery driver was robbed by an armed man. The driver reported to police that the gunman took an undisclosed amount of cash, along with a pizza and the delivery bag it was in.

Further delivery drivers were threatened at gunpoint and robbed of their cash throughout that night in Ann Arbor and throughout Ypsilanti Township. Police say only pizza delivery drivers were targeted. A K-9 Unit assisted with the investigation, but was not successful.

Pittsfield Township police worked together with the Ann Arbor police and the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office in apprehending the suspects. According to a recent press release made by Pittsfield Township, all three range in age from 16 to 18, and are residents of Washtenaw County.

Police have not yet released the names of the suspects due to their juvenile status. Other than the description of one as being a six-foot tall white male with a heavy set build and short brown hair provided after the first robbery, nothing is known about the three suspects.
