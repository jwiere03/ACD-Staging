<h2>Charged After Assaulting Homeless Man</h2>
Martin R. Miller, the 30-year-old former marine who attacked a homeless man who was staying with Miller and his wife, after the three engaged in a threesome, has chosen to waive his right to a preliminary examination, and instead anticipates accepting a plea bargain.<!--more-->

According to the Prosecutor's Office, the plea offer requires that Miller pleads guilty or no contest to a single count of attempted assault by strangulation, which is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. In return, the prosecution will no longer pursue the assault by strangulation charge, which is a ten year felony.

These charges are the result of an incident that occurred on September 12th, after Miller physically attacked Michael A. Chaney, the 20-year-old who was staying with Miller and his wife, Daniela Miller. According to Chaney's testimony, MIller threatened, kicked, and choked him after a verbal confrontation.

The two were at odds because Chaney, while staying at their home, engaged in sexual relations with both Miller and Daniela simultaneously. However, after that particular instance, Chaney and Daniella continued a relationship without Miller's knowledge, although it appears that he suspected it.

"Martin became jealous after we had a threesome because Daniela started to distance herself from him." Chaney told police, which ultimately led to the confrontation in which Miller kicked and choked Chaney. Daniela Miller came with Chaney to the hospital in order to corroborate his story to police.

Investigating officers arrived at Millers home and confronted him about Chaney's allegations. Miller didn't deny the events, telling the officers, "I am a marine. When someone challenges me I go into kill mode." However, Miller did claim that Chaney never passed out as a result of the choke hold, as he had claimed. "He didn't lose consciousness, but I did it hard enough for him to know."

Miller was arrested and charged. During his arraignment, he told the judge that he suffers from bipolar disorder. Miller is scheduled to enter his plea in the Bay County District Court, before Judge Dawn A. Klida, on October 9th at 2:30 pm.
