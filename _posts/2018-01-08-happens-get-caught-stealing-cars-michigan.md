&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days ago we posted an </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/new-years-day-one-top-days-car-theft.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article about stealing cars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and stealing things out of cars - money, sunglasses, purses, and other valuables. This has resulted in a number of phone calls from people wondering about </span><b>what happens if they get caught stealing things from cars</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan. It's certainly a valid question, and one that many people wonder about. So we figured we'd break it down for you.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is it called when you steal things out of cars in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, stealing items from inside a car is covered under the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/larceny-motor-vehicle-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larceny From a Motor Vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statute. </span><b>Stealing from cars is, in most cases, a felony</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan. However, the specific charge would depend on the value of the items stolen from the vehicle. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Does it matter </b><b><i>what</i></b><b> you steal out of a car?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes indeed! As we just mentioned, what you steal will have an effect on the charges you face. For example, if you </span><b>steal a handful of change out of someone's car</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the value of the stolen property is less than $200.00, and you'll be charged with a misdemeanor. The penalty is no more than 93 days in jail, a fine of up to $500.00, (or 3 times the value of the property value, whichever is greater), or both.The prosecutor might add on other charges such as malicious destruction of property if you broke a window, popped an ignition or caused other damage to the car. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you steal </span><b>an expensive laptop, a cell phone and a designer pair of sunglasses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of a car, you're looking at a much more serious charge. At that point, assuming the specific value of the three items combined is more than $1,000.00 and less than $20,000.00, you're looking at </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a felony punishable by up to 5 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00 (or 3 times the value of the property, whichever is greater) or both. This is serious stuff, folks!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What happens if the car is damaged during the theft?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you break a window, bend the body, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tear the seat covers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or do any damage to a vehicle while you're stealing things out of it, this will affect your charges. For example, if you only steal a very, inexpensive items out of a car, but </span><b>break the window in the process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can increase the charge from a misdemeanor to a felony. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What about if you have prior charges?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a criminal record when you're arrested for stealing out of a car, this will also affect the charges you're likely to face. So if you get caught with less than $200 worth of things taken from a car in Michigan (which is a misdemeanor) but </span><b>you've already got a prior conviction on your record</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that misdemeanor just became a felony.</span>

&nbsp;
