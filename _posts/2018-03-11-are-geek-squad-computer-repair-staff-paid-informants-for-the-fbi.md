&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever had your computer act up, perhaps freezing or crashing in the middle of important functions? Many people have. And what does one do, when your computer is on the fritz? </span><b>Simple, you call in the experts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whether it's Best Buy's Geek Squad, or your local equivalent tech gurus, the people you need are the computer doctors who can make sense of that complex code and have </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/computer-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your online access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back up and running ASAP! </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But have you ever wondered, while those computer geeks are rooting around in there to figure out what's wrong, what else they may be doing? Are they reading your private files? Scrolling through your browser history to see </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/federal-child-pornography-laws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what sites you've visited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><b>Or perhaps they're looking at the videos and pictures you have stored on your device.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It may seem improbable, but as it turns out, that's exactly what was happening with computers taken to the Geek Squad at Best Buy, to be fixed.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Are the Geek Squad techs informants for the FBI?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents made public by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in the wake of a freedom of information lawsuit filed in 2017, certain Best Buy Geek Squad managers are on the FBI payroll. How is that possible, you wonder? Well, the documents show that for at least 10 years, t</span><b>he FBI's Louisville division has been making payments to Geek Squad managers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the area in return for information about illegal materials found on customers computers.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The specific wording in the documents cite that the connection between Geek Squad management and members of the </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI's Computer Intrusion and Cyber Crime division</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was aimed at getting "case initiations." In other words, when a customer brought their computer in to Best Buy to be repaired, </span><b>the manager was reporting any illegal materials that techs found to the FBI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But was it something they stumbled across during the course of repairing the device, or where they looking for it?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The difference may not seem like it matters, but it does!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about it. If you take your computer in to be repaired and in the course of recovering lost data, the tech happens to stumble on </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-child-pornography-laws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child pornography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or some other illegal materials) it makes sense that they would report it. After all, Best Buy's policy is that if any of their techs encounter anything illegal on a customer's computer, </span><b>they are duty bound to report it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But there is a big difference between "stumbled onto" and "went searching for."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If paid informants for the FBI were searching the contents of your computer without your knowledge, that could constitute a violation of your constitutional rights, which protect you from unwarranted searches and seizures. So </span><b>is it illegal for Geek Squad members to rifle through your private files without your consent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, looking for signs of illegal activity on behalf of the FBI? The </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic Frontier Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believes it is. The criminal defense attorneys here at The Kronzek Firm say they believe that Best Buy employees were acting as agents of the police. If so, customer’s computers were subject to searches that should be protected by the Fourth Amendment protection against warrantless searches. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Is the FBI conducting illegal searches of people's computers?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the EFF's interpretation of the information, Geek Squad managers would reach out when they found something questionable, and an agent would come to the site to review what had been discovered. </span><b>After they had looked through the discovered images or videos</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they would determine is the content was enough to proceed into the criminal justice system. If it was, they would seize the device and open an investigation, at which point they would </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seek a warrant to search</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the device.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the EFF, any search made by the Geek Squad on behalf of the FBI should be viewed by the court as </span><b>a warrantless search "carried out by Proxy."</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And all information discovered during warrantless searches should be thrown out of court because they violate the owner’s Fourth Amendment rights. It will be interesting to see how this lawsuit progresses, and what the outcome is, as it may impact numerous cases in the future here in Michigan and elsewhere!</span>
