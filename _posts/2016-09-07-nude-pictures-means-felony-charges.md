<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigans-revenge-porn-law.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan's revenge porn laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have recently changed, for one woman from Bay City that doesn't seem to have made any difference to the charges she is facing. 22-year-old Stephanie J. Knapp of Bay County, Michigan, has been accused of posting nude pictures of another woman to Facebook, and the charges she is facing as a result have nothing to do with </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan-criminal-sexual-conduct-csc-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sex crime charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Bay County Sheriff's Department, one of their deputies took a call on March 27, 2016 from a woman who claimed that Knapp was </span><b>harassing her by posting nude pictures of her online</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The alleged victim, a 20-year-old woman from Bangor Township, claimed that Knapp had posted pictures of her on Facebook that she had previously shared with a man she was dating.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman told the deputy that she had formerly been in a relationship with a man whom she sent nude pictures of herself to. These images included pictures of her genitalia. She claims that </span><b>the man must have shared the images with others after their relationship ended</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She also claimed that Knapp had </span><b>openly admitted in the comments under one of the images that she had been the one to post them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Facebook.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the woman, she and Knapp had been friends about a year before but had a falling out over a man. The deputy told her that she would need to </span><b>provide proof of the allegations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before he could continue the investigation. The alleged victim sent him a number of </span><b>screen shots that included nude pictures of her on Facebook</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along with the comments posted underneath.</span>

&nbsp;

<h2>Phone with pics had been stolen at party</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The deputy contacted the man who the images were initially sent to, but he said that the phone he had stored those pictures on had been </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-larceny-attorney-larceny-building-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stolen at a party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some time before. He said that he hadn't had access to those pictures in a while and had no idea who had them now.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on, the deputy then attempted to contact Knapp, but was unable to locate her. He did note, however, that </span><b>she was already wanted on an outstanding warrant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The warrant stemmed from not paying court fines on a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domestic violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conviction from 2014. A second warrant was issued on August 22, 2016 and Knapp </span><b>appeared voluntarily for her arraignment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bay County District Court on August 29th.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knapp was charged with single counts of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-of-a-computer-to-commit-a-crime-in-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a Computer to Commit a Crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Unlawful Posting of a Message. </span><b>These charges are both felonies, with the first one being punishable by up to four years in prison, and the second one being a two year felony</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knapp was released on a personal recognizance bond and was told that she was </span><b>still required to pay the $580 in fines that she owes as a result of her 2015 domestic violence conviction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He preliminary examination is scheduled for Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 2 pm.</span>
