Everyone has been issued a wise word or two during their lifetime, and benefited from it.  Things like, "treat others the way you want to be treated", "wash your hands after using the bathroom" and "never pick your nose in public" may be well used and seemingly worn out by now, but they are valuable nonetheless.

So while "don't drive your mobile meth lab to a meeting with your parole officer" may not sound like something you would hear every day, it turns out someone could have used those few extra words of wisdom recently. Or perhaps just used a hefty serving of common sense.<!--more-->

According to Van Buren County Sheriff's Deputies, the 55-year-old suspect arrived for a meeting with his parole officer recently, with a car full of meth making components. The deputies said that he pulled right into the parking lot of the Van Buren County Courthouse in Paw Paw, parked his car, and then simply left it there while he conducted his meeting.

Apparently the deputies had received a tip from someone in the community that the suspect was traveling in a vehicle that contained meth making supplies. Sgt. Ron Douglas of the Van Buren County Sheriff's Department says that he is grateful that the public is so helpful with regard to reporting crime. "We are pretty vigilant as to what's going on around us. It really helps that the public is vigilant also and looking out for criminal activity, so individuals call us regularly."

The suspect's car was searched and in the truck deputies discovered three items used to make meth - Walgreen's instant cold packs, Roto drain opener and lye. As a result of these discoveries, the deputies were able to get a warrant and search the man's home in Antwerp Township .

During the search, officers found several guns along with ammunition, and a variety of meth supplies and even some of the finished product. According to the Van Buren County Sheriff's Department, this is the third meth bust that officers have made in the last 24 hours, which is a rather alarming rise in meth related arrests for the county.

The suspect, whose name will be released after arraignment, is facing drug possession charges, and felon in possession of a firearm charges. He is currently back in jail, at the Van Buren County Jail.
