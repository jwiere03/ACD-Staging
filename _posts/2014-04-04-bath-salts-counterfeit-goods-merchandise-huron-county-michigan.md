Robert David Alent, a 49 year old man from Bad Axe, was sentenced in May of 2013 to two to seven years in prison for eight felony charges. He was convicted of delivering 'bath salts' - a lab-created drug containing synthetic chemicals that are similar to amphetamines, and of maintaining a drug house in both his home and his business.

A few days ago, Alent appeared in the Huron County Circuit Courtroom via teleconference. He now faces additional charges of tobacco products tax violation and delivery/possession of counterfeit goods. He is serving his current sentence at the Thumb Correctional Facility in Lapeer.  The new charges are felony charges, each of which carries a 5 year potential prison sentence.

<h2>Tobacco products tax violation is a felony</h2>

The added charges result from a separate investigation into Alent's business, a store called Maple Lane Discount in Verona Township.  Apparently the store was in possession of several hundred dollars worth of tobacco products Alent could not account for through invoices. Tobacco products tax violation is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

In addition, Alent was found to be in possession of 170 pairs of counterfeit Oakley brand sunglasses. A representative from Oakley estimated that the sunglasses, had they been legally for sale, would have cost a very minimum of $100 each, making the total value in excess of $17,000. Delivery or possession of counterfeit goods is also a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.

A good overview on counterfeit good can be found at <a title="Capp Paper on Counterfeit Goods" href="http://a-capp.msu.edu/sites/default/files/files/PC_Michigan_Paper_Final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

Alent is also being charged as a habitual offender, this being his fourth offense. This increases the maximum prison sentence to life. He pled not guilty to the additional charges.
