Being pulled over for a minor traffic violation is a frustrating and stressful event for every motorist. And unfortunately, these occurrences have become more common for people throughout the State of Michigan. The number of ticketed drivers helped by aggressive Michigan criminal defense lawyers are rising at alarming rates--coincidentally occurring alongside a dwindling state revenue and economy.

Those responsible for enforcing Michigan traffic laws are largely involved in the dramatic increase in tickets issued. It is not uncommon for law enforcement officials throughout Metropolitan Detroit to be required to issue a particular number of violations. However, police chiefs watch their language carefully, making sure that they do not order prohibited "quotas."

The State of Michigan officially banned motor vehicle ticket quotas in 1979, only to be virtually nullified by a provision approved in 1988. From that time on, the number of issued tickets is considered when giving police officers evaluations, as long as it is weighed equally against other factors as well. According to the President of the Police Officers Association of Michigan, James Tagnanelli, the provision serves as a bit of a loophole. "Chiefs never like to use the 'Q' word, but they're certainly telling officers they have to write 'X' amount of tickets," he explained.


<h2>Police under unprecedented pressure to issue tickets for motorists</h2>

Police officers throughout Metro Detroit agree with Tagnanelli, stating that they are under an unprecedented amount of pressure to issue tickets for motorists. Emphasis was particularly placed on the number of citations written as the state economy unravels, as doing so generates a considerable amount of money. As the economic downturn as hit Michigan particularly hard over the past six years, state revenues have decreased by $3 billion. Concurrently, a study of court and police records performed by the Detroit News reported that the amount of tickets issued to drivers has significantly risen over the past six years.

Tagnanelli explained the correlation, stating "Police departments are being pressured to bring in more money by writing tickets. So we're seeing more and more of these performance standards, which are basically quotas." His claims are supported by various examples of ticket mandates required by various law enforcement departments throughout the Metro Detroit area:
<ul>
	<li>Trenton police officers are subjected to annual performance evaluations unless they issue 15 tickets each month.</li>
	<li>Law enforcement officials in Rochester are expected to give out 1.5 tickets throughout a 8 hour shift--or in other words, 30 each month.</li>
	<li>In order to be rated "satisfactory" on performance reviews, Oak Park cops must write at least one ticket every other day.</li>
	<li>Dearborn Heights police officers are required to write between 12 and 15 tickets each week.</li>
</ul>
The Police Officers Association of Michigan has protested the ticket requirements; in Rochester and Oak Park, numerous law enforcement officials have complained that they were inappropriately disciplined because their evaluations were almost entirely based on traffic enforcement. Unfortunately, in both cases their reports were ignored, as each was lost in arbitration.

Although setting ticket requirements for police officers may generate more revenue, it certainly does not guarantee proper and just law enforcement. Because officers are subject to discipline unless they issue a certain number of citations, more motorists are being pulled over for absurd violations.
