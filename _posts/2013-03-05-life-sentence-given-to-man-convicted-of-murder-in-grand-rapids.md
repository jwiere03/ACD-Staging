The sentencing of Karl Cotton Jr. took place last week in a Kent County circuit courtroom, with Cotton, who was convicted of murdering a young woman named Jamie Powell, receiving life in prison. Judge Mark Trusock gave out the sentence, which did not include the possibility of parole.


<h2>Reports also indicate that Cotton robbed Powell</h2>

According to prosecutors in March of 2011 Jamie Powell was murdered by Cotton, 25, in her own apartment. News reports say that on the night of the murder Cotton was orchestrating a drug deal between himself and Ante Webb in Powell’s home. Webb is reportedly the brother of Powell’s ex-boyfriend . Powell was in the home at the time too; however, police maintain she was not part of the drug deal. Prosecutors claimed that after the deal was complete Webb left the house, but heard gunshots from inside. Police later found Powell dead in her bathroom; she was 30 years old at the time of the shooting. Reports also indicate that Cotton robbed Powell of several thousand dollars.

Jim Powell, the victim’s father, read a statement at the sentencing. As Cotton was being led away after his sentencing one of the family members of the victim reportedly told Cotton Happy Valentine’s Day in a mocking tone, to which Cotton replied in kind.

Cotton said in a statement given during the sentencing that he denies the charges and fully intends to appeal the conviction. The chances of successfully appealing a criminal conviction after jury trial are statistically low. It is important to remember that the best defense always comes from a well prepared Michigan Criminal defense attorney.
