<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuataina Afutiti is accused of embezzling more than two million dollars from the Veterans Health Administration Credit Union. She </span><b>worked as the credit union's president and chief executive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She is a resident of Westland, which is located in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayne County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near Detroit. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to press releases put out by the Michigan Attorney General's Office, Afutiti has been charged with single counts of Receiving Proceeds from a Continuing </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/retail-crime.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminal Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a credit union. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">She was arraigned before Magistrate Bari Blake Wood in the 36th District Court in Detroit and  she was granted a personal recognizance bond of $10,000. The conditions of her </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bail-bonds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are that she must </span><b>surrender her passport, is not allowed to leave the state of Michigan, and can have no contact with witnesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in the case.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation was started in February of 2016 during a </span><b>routine audit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Credit Union Examiners from the State of Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) discovered possible misconduct. </span><b>The subsequent investigation revealed serious irregularities that Afutiti was unable to explain</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Attorney General’s press release, the alleged embezzlement took place between 2012 and 2016, up until the Credit Union closed in May of this year. In addition, closer inspection of her financial history shows that she used some of that money to </span><b>lease numerous vehicles and purchase a 2013 Mercedes Benz</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She also allegedly </span><b>bought a $100,000 motorhome  and several expensive vacations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, </span><b>the total amount of money stolen from the Credit Union was $2,303,158.66</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For that reason, claims A.G. Shuette, the Credit Union was forced into insolvency and therefore had to close in May 2016.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In press release, Schuette explained why he was so upset by the allegations. "For a person to </span><b>take advantage of Michigan veterans, many of whom are disabled and on fixed incomes, to use the money to live a life of excess is despicable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These men and women gave so much to allow us the freedoms we have in this country and anyone who takes advantage of that will face the consequences."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement is a very serious crime in Michigan. It </span><b>can result in decades behind bars if the prosecutor is successful in convincing a jury that someone stole money that wasn't theirs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
