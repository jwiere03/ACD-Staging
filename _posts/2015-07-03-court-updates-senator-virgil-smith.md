Politicians work very hard to be in the spotlight. But this often backfires when they make a mistake, and end up with constant media coverage of every aspect of their humiliation. Just as Flint Councilman, <a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/eric-mays-trial/">Eric Mays</a>, had every minute of his court appearances documented for public consumption, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/state-senator-virgil-smith-arrested.html">Detroit Senator Virgil Smith</a> is likely to suffer the same.<!--more-->

Senator Smith is charged with<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"> felonious assault,</a> malicious destruction of personal property - $20,000 or more, misdemeanor <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank">domestic violence</a>, assault and battery, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. He appeared in the Wayne County's 36th District Court on May 22nd for a probable cause hearing, at which time the prosecution chose not to offer him a plea bargain.

According to testimony from Smith's ex-wife, Anite Thomas, she arrived at Smith's house expecting to spend the night with him, but instead found another woman in his bed. Although they are divorced, Thomas says that she and Smith have rekindled their intimacy, and staying the night with him was a regular occurrence.


<h2>Claims that he punched her repeatedly in the face</h2>

The fight that she claimed ensued was almost entirely Smith's fault. She says that he punched her repeatedly in the face, smashed her face into the carpet, and pressed on the back of her neck until she stopped breathing. She also said that Smith pointed the gun at her after shooting at her car.

But Tatiana Grant was the "other woman" there that night, and she paints a very different picture of the evening's events. According to Grant, Smith didn't punch or hit Thomas. Instead, he was simply trying to defend her from Thomas' very evident attempts to attack her. District Judge Michael Wagner, after hearing the testimony of both Thomas and Grant, decided that there was probable cause. He bound the case over for trial.

Kym Worthy, the Wayne County Prosecutor, has recused herself in the past from prosecuting Smith, courtesy of her longtime work relationship with Smith's father - a judge in Wayne County. But on this particular occasion she has said she won't. Smith has been prosecuted in the past on several drunk driving charges.

Since his arrest, Virgil Smith has been removed from all of his committee assignments and leadership roles within the Michigan State Legislature.
