<h3 dir="ltr">Muskegon Meth Attorneys</h3>
<p dir="ltr">MSP's West Michigan Enforcement Team recently received information that items used in the creation of meth had been discovered in a dumpster behind a local bar in Egelston Township. Inside the dumpster was a gym bag containing a variety of items commonly used in the "one-pot" meth production method, also called the "shake 'n bake" method.  This evidence led to yet another Muskegon Meth arrest.</p>
Police say this method of cooking meth is becoming more and more common of late.  A meth cook using "one-pot" synthesis can create meth in less than an hour in their backyard, in a backpack, or even in a car while driving around. But while the 'one-pot' method may be faster and easier, it is no less dangerous and can easily result in fires, explosions, toxic exposure and even death.


<h2>Police say Babcock is a repeat-offender</h2>

The police traced the meth equipment back to Benjamin Davis Babcock of Muskegon County. Babcock has been arrested on charges of possession of chemical or laboratory equipment used for manufacturing methamphetamines. Police say Babcock is a repeat-offender with a lengthy criminal history, in addition to being a parole absconder, which means that he did not report to his parole officer in accordance with the terms of his release from prison.

Babcock was arrested on March 25th and is currently being held in the Muskegon County Jail awaiting arraignment. If convicted on the meth charges, Babcock may serve up to 20 years in prison, beyond what he gets for his pending parole violation. The severity of the proposed sentence is due in part to his status as a habitual offender.   Under Michigan law, repeat drug crime offenders are sentenced harshly and repeat felons also have enhanced sentences.

According to the law in Michigan, possession of methamphetamines is a felony punishable by up to ten years in prison, a $15,000 fine, or both. However the actual production of meth is one of the most <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html">serious felony drug charges</a> under Michigan Law. If convicted you may face up to twenty years in prison and pay fines up to $25,000, or both. It is crucial, when charged with a meth related crime, to be represented by an experienced drug crime attorney to ensure the best defense possible for your case.
