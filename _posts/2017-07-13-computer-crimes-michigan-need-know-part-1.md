&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The term "</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/computer-crimes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" can seem a little vague, and with good reason - it includes a wide spectrum of criminal activity. From child pornography to financial fraud, there are many ways that a person can </span><b>use a computer to break the law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, when it comes to being charged for computer crimes, sometimes called 'cyber crimes' in Michigan, there are some facts you need to keep in mind.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First we're going to take a look at the different types of </span><b>crimes that involve the use of computers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then we'll spend a few minutes looking at the different types of charges that a person may face in Michigan as a result. Understand though, that a “computer” is broadly defined in Michigan law and also includes cell phones in addition to regular computers. The definition also includes computer peripherals such as detached hard drives or other storage devices. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Identity theft:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identity theft is such a common catch phrase now that it hardly needs an explanation. However, it is </span><b>becoming more and more difficult to protect ourselves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this digital age. As </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the FBI cyber crimes site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clearly explains, "Cyber intrusions are becoming more commonplace, more dangerous, and more sophisticated."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identity theft can often result in someone else stealing your personal information, property or belongings, a line of credit, employment opportunities, and much more. Because personal identifying information often includes </span><b>Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, bank accounts logins, and credit card information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can be devastating to the victim's life. For this reason, and because identity theft is the most common computer crime today, prosecution of this crime is vigorous in Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Hacking:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hacking can refer to a number of different cyber crimes, but is most commonly used to refer to unlawful and unauthorized access to the data in a closed system. This can be either for the purposes of </span><b>stealing the information inside that system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or for the more malicious purpose of planting viruses and other malware. Hackers are very difficult to track, and therefore very hard to catch and prosecute. Once caught, however, prosecutors in Michigan will do everything in their power to press charges.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Child Pornography:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, child pornography is called "</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-child-pornography-laws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child sexually abusive material</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">." The term refers to any image or recording of </span><b>a person under the age of 18 who is engaging in any type of sexual intercourse or interaction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or is displayed naked in an erotic way. Because child porn is usually shared online, often on the dark web, and stored on computers, laptops and mobile devices, it is considered to be a cyber crime.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Soliciting a minor:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, most </span><a href="https://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/solicitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solicitation for sex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn't happen on street corners. Rather, it takes place online, through dating sites and personals ads on Craigslist, Backpage, and other similar sites. So people who are accused of soliciting sex from a minor are usually </span><b>in contact with that minor online</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, through a some kind of social media or message app. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Revenge pornography:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenge porn has made headlines in Michigan in recent years, because we have only passed laws dealing with revenge porn in the last two years. Although the concept of </span><b>humiliating someone as a way of getting back at them for breaking your heart</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> probably isn't new, the use of computers to achieve this is recent. In Michigan, posting sexually explicit pictures of someone online, or on any social media sites, without their permission can result in steep fines and jail time.</span>
