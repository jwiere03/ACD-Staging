One cardinal rule we learn growing up is: do not take what does not belong to you. In addition to being common courtesy, this particular golden rule can help one steer clear of run-ins with the law. One does not have to be a criminal lawyer in Michigan to know that the unauthorized taking of property from an organization is illegal, and bring about a lot of problems -- regardless of fame, popularity, or public status. An example of this is seen in the recent case of a Michigan State University football player who was one of ten people arrested for involvement in a theft ring targeting Detroit Public Schools.
<h2>104 Laptops Stolen From Detroit Schools</h2>
According to Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, between December 2009 and February 2010, 104 laptop computers were stolen from various Detroit Public Schools. The culprits then sold the merchandise on eBay, Craigslist, as well as to friends and acquaintances. Ultimately,  stolen laptops were located by DPS  investigators across the country and abroad.

Currently, Wayne County prosecutors have named ten young men as suspects in this crime, all ranging in age between 18 and 22. Among the men accused is Dion Sims, a talented football player at Michigan State University, who is facing theft charges or receiving and concealing stolen property in Michigan for his role in the heist. Because of the pending counts against him, Sims has been indefinitely suspended from the football team, not likely to see any game time action in the 2010 season.  It is likely that Simms will be sentenced under the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/hyta-sentencing.html" target="_blank">Holmes Youthful Trainee Act</a> (HYTA).  Under this treatment, Simms would have the opportunity to have the record expunged after his probation is completed.

While most of the suspects (including Sims) are accused of receiving and concealing stolen property, three of the men have much more severe charges against them. Brian Rogers, 20, Dwaine Scott, 19, and Mark Scott, 18 are all believed to be members of the local Helly Helly Bois gang, the group that supposedly organized the heist. These three men are also charged with conducting criminal enterprises, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">breaking and entering</a>, and larceny. If convicted of the crimes listed against them, it is almost certain that each will face life-changing consequences including excessive fines and lengthy jail sentences.

As seen by the example of Dion Sims and the nine other young men accused, being suspected of criminal charges is a difficult and scary experience for anyone to go through, regardless of public status. If accused of theft charges similar to those described above, it is essential to contact experienced and aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank">criminal attorneys in Michigan</a> for assistance. Doing so immediately is the first step one can take to ensure the legal advice and legal representation needed to defend your reputation, as well as your personal freedoms and liberties.
