<h2>MSP Investigates Urinalysis Bribes</h2>
"Urine technician" might not sound like a very desirable job. But the people who collect urine samples and test them for traces of illegal drugs do very important work. However, according to police, one such person in Saginaw was accepting bribes in return for producing "clean drop" urine test results for parolees.<!--more-->

The accused, a 58-year-old resident of Saginaw, is employed by Bay Technical Staffing. Bay Technical Staffing is contracted to do urinalysis for the Michigan Department of Corrections. Apparently the MDOC was suspicious of this technician. They suspected he was forging false results. Or possibly never even conducting the screening.

An investigation was opened by the Michigan State Police, hoping to discover what was really going on. An undercover officer, posing as a parolee, went in to provide an allegedly court-ordered urine sample. The technician offered to ensure that the sample would provide a clean drop result in return for $50.

He was immediately arrested by members of the Bay Area Narcotics Enforcement Team. He was discovered to have a large quantity of cash on his person. The arrest warrant cites "Obstruction of Justice." Under Michigan law this is a felony punishable by up to two years in prison and fines of up to $2,000.

The Michigan penal code explains obstruction of justice as any attempt by an individual to obstruct, assault, wound or endanger a police officer, court employee, parole officer, judge, medical examiner, or any other person who is involved in the criminal justice process. While this charge often refers to someone attempting to fight back during an arrest, in this case it simply refers to someone who interfered with a criminal justice process.

Apparently, after his arrest, the technician admitted his actions to police. He said that he sometimes accepts cash in return for providing the MDOC with a clean drop urinalysis report for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank">parolees</a> who might otherwise have had drug-positive results.

Although we do not know for certain whether the technician actually did admit his actions to police, it brings up a good point. If you are ever arrested, remember, you have the right to remain silent. Use it.
