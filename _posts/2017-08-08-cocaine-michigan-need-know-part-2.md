<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thanks for joining us here at The Kronzek Firm. We're in the process of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine-michigan-need-know-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unpacking the subject of cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both it's history and it's </span><b>current consequences under Michigan law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moving forward, we're going to answer more of your questions about cocaine, and hopefully give you a clearer picture of what you're up against if you choose to use cocaine in Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Was cocaine legal once?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes it was. In fact, it was not only legal to use and sell, but it was also used in numerous products, from drinks and over-the-counter medicines to health tonics and even children's products. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was used in toothache cures, to help children get over shyness, as a pick-me-up in cigars, and in soda. (That's where Coca-cola got it's name, after all!)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Does cocaine affect your health if you use it a lot?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine affects your health even if you don't use it often. Although studies have shown that cocaine can alter brain structure and function if used repeatedly, there are also side effects even if you only use it occasionally. Those can include:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiety or panic attacks</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in behavior</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood swings</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paranoia</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restlessness</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncontrollable twitching and tics</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convulsions</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What happens if I get arrested for cocaine in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to this question depends on how much cocaine you are accused of having, and what the police believe you were doing with it. Use, possession, manufacture and delivery are all treated differently, with different sentences handed down for each. Penalties under federal law are more severe than being charged under Michigan’s law. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What if I'm caught using cocaine in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine use is a misdemeanor in Michigan. If you are caught and convicted of using cocaine, you could be facing up to one year in jail, and a fine of up to $2,000, or both.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What about if I'm caught with cocaine in my possession?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine possession is much more serious, and the sentence will depend on how much cocaine you had with you when you were arrested.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you had less than 50 grams at the time of your arrest, you could go to prison for up to 4 years, and pay a fine of up to $25,000, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you had between 50 and 449 grams of cocaine, you're facing up to 20 years in prison, and a fine of up to $250,000, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you had between 450 and 999 grams of cocaine, you're looking at a possible prison sentence of up to 30 years, plus fines of up to $500,000, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you possessed 1,000 grams or more of cocaine, you could go to prison for up to your entire life, and also pay a fine of $1,000,000, or both.</span></li>
</ul>
