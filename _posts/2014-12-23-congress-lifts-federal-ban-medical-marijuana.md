Last week, an important change in drug policy slipped under the radar. Inside a spending measure over 1,600 pages long is a provision to end the federal ban on medical marijuana. This is the first time that Congress has supported this type of change.<!--more-->

This means States that have legalized medical marijuana use would no longer have to be concerned about federal raids of retail operations. In other words, such raids would be barred. Drug advocates can now breathe a sigh of relief that the battle between states and the federal government over this issue will now end.

Rep. Barbara Lee applauded the change. She stated that the government should never interfere with citizens being able to access their medication.


<h2>Federal raids of legal operators narrowed to accused of other offenses</h2>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Last year the government ordered federal prosecutors last year to stop cracking down with drug laws that are contrary to state medical marijuana statutes.  Since that time, federal raids of legal operators have been narrowed to those accused of other offenses like money laundering. While every state that has legalized medical pot has different laws and policies, including those regarding whether dispensaries are allowed, this policy shift is extremely encouraging for all those who require drug therapy as a health necessity.  </span>

"Now the fight moves on to legalization of all marijuana," said Bill Piper, a lobbyist with the <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/" target="_blank">Drug Policy Alliance</a>. "This is the strongest signal we have received from Congress (that) the politics have really shifted. Congress has been slow to catch up with the states and American people, but it is catching up."

Although some lawmakers are still uneasy about the shift and the idea of full legalization, ending the war on medical pot is a historic victory and a step in the right direction.
