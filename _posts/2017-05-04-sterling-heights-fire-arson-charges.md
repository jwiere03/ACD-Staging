&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At about 3 am on Friday morning, police and firefighters in Macomb County, Michigan were called to a Sterling Heights home on Bloomingdale, in response to a house fire. By the time they arrived, the blaze had already caused a great deal of smoke, but </span><b>firefighters were able to contain the blaze before it spread</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and engulfed the entire home.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the home wasn't completely destroyed and </span><b>numerous people got out with little to no injuries as a result, one young man lost his life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 17-year-old Matthew Marroki-Yaldo was found trapped in his upstairs bedroom, where he was lying on his bed, passed out from smoke inhalation. Macomb County officials say the bedroom door was open, allowing smoke to pour into the room unimpeded.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefighters used a ladder to access the second story, and dragged Marroki-Yaldo out through the window.</span><b> He was transported to Detroit Receiving Hospital, but was dead by the time he arrived</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the </span><a href="https://www.oakgov.com/me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland County Medical Examiner’s Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Marroki-Yaldo died from smoke and soot inhalation.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marroki-Yaldo's parents were also treated for smoke inhalation, and his father, Laith Marroki-Yaldo, was later transferred to Detroit Receiving Hospital as well. Both parents are now doing well, along with </span><b>two other siblings who were at home when the fire started</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but who weren't injured. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators quickly determined that the fire was intentionally set, having started on a couch in the first floor den. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They met with the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office on Monday to review the findings from the investigation. As of now, it is expected that </span><b>Marroki-Yaldo's older, 20-year-old brother will be charged with arson</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Currently he is the only suspect in the case. In addition to possible arson charges, the suspect may also be facing </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charges as a result of his younger brother's death. Felony murder is punishable by up to life in prison. </span>
