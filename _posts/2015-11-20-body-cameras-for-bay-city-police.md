<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of public outcry about police brutality and abuse of power, more and more police departments across the nation are looking for ways to increase accountability. And to prove an officer's innocence, if need be. One of the ways that seems to have received much favorable review? Body cameras. And that, the Bay City Police Department has decided, is an effort worth investing in.</span><!--more--><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 6 am on Thursday, November 28, the first shift to hit the streets will be armed with the usual gun, handcuffs, and taser. In addition, officers will now come equipped with a body camera. </span>
<h2>A Win-Win For the Public and the Officers</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay City Public Safety Director Michael J. Cecchini, the body cameras are "a win-win for the public and the officers." In part, this is because there will be video evidence of every police encounter. This will enhance the amount of evidence available for investigative study and for court. Additionally, body cameras increase officer accountability. Officers know that they are being recorded and so they are required to be more circumspect in their actions.</span>

But from the perspective of the Bay City Public Safety Department, one of the biggest bonuses is that the cameras will protect their officers. No, not from stray bullets and violent detainees. Instead, from false accusations and slander.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Cecchini, the department conducted some very serious research into other departments around the country. They discovered one very important piece of information. In a great many cases where a civilian accused an officer of misconduct, body camera footage proved that the officer in question was innocent. And this is what Bay City wants for it's officers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The department has invested in 40 cameras. 38 will be used in active rotation and 2 will be kept as back ups in the event of equipment failure or breakage. This, they say, will equip every officer on the shift with a body camera that is constantly recording every conversation, every incident, every interaction. Â </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cameras, which are created and distributed by <a href="https://www.taser.com/" target="_blank">Taser</a>, come with guarantees of complete free replacement in the event of malfunction and damage. The cameras themselves are equipped with full audio and video capabilities. That includes 130 degree lens, a 12 hour battery, low light recording, and a 30 second "dump", which means that information is uploaded to the cloud every 30 seconds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully this investment results in more honest police and community interactions in the future.</span>
