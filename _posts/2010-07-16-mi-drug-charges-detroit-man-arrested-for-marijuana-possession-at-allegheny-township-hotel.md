If law enforcement officials approach you regarding controlled substances, you should be very afraid. Distributing or possessing illicit drugs is illegal according to federal law and can land the suspect in a great deal of trouble. Although Michigan voters enacted legislation in 2008 providing for medicinal marijuana use, recreational use of the drug for those without clearance cards is still against the law. Ask any experienced criminal defense attorney in Michigan--the consequences for drug crimes can be harsh, including fines and long jail sentences.
<h2>Numerous Drug Charges for Michigan Man Including Possession and Intent to Deliver</h2>
Such an example is seen in a recent case where law enforcement officials arrested a Detroit man on drug charges in Michigan after discovering that he was in <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank">possession of marijuana</a> in an Allegheny Township hotel.

On July 15th, employees of Plank Road hotel noticed two small children wandering around the halls of the building in search of their parents. Hotel workers phoned law enforcement officials who began the search for the boys father, whom they only knew by "Larry." When their room was finally located, police searched the room to find an undisclosed amount of marijuana, as well as $3,350 in cash. While the investigation was being conducted, the suspect and the boys' father Larry M. Johnson, 27, stood outside the room. It was later discovered by police that he also had another $2,009 in cash and a digital scale in his pockets.

Following the police search of the hotel room, officers arrested Johnson for numerous criminal charges including: possession with intent to deliver, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, as well as endangering the welfare of children charges.Â  Instead of paying the $20,000 bond held against him, Johnson is being held in the Blair County Prison awaiting a preliminary hearing on July 22nd. If he is eventually convicted of the charges against him, he will ultimately be subjected to several harsh punishments such as substantial fines, probation, and jail time.

As seen by the example of Larry Johnson, a Michigan drug arrest is no laughing matter. Being found in possession of illegal controlled substances, such as marijuana, will prompt your arrest and the restriction of your personal freedoms. To protect yourself from the negative consequences of drug charges, a suspect must be proactive in seeking the best legal defense possible for their case.
