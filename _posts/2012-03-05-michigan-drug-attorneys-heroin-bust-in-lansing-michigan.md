Police in Lansing, Michigan recently seized nearly one kilogram of heroin from an apartment on Forest Road. The heroin has a street value of around $75,000. Timothy Gill, supervisor of the Tri-County Metro Narcotics Squad, said that this was the largest seizure of heroin by the Tri-County Metro Narcotics Squad he has seen in his 13 years of supervising that drug enforcement task force. Tri-County Metro is an agency comprised of officers for several police agencies in and around Ingham County, Michigan. It includes police officers from the Lansing Police Department, Meridian Township Police, Ingham County Sheriff, East Lansing Police Department and MSU Police.


<h2>Bell charged with several felony counts</h2>

Police executed a <a title="Search and Seizure in Michigan" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html">search warrant</a> after making several undercover purchases from a resident of the apartment. The suspect, Christopher Bell, was arrested and recently charged with several felony counts relating to heroin delivery and heroin possession. He was already on <a title="Michigan Probation Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html">probation</a> for a 2010 heroin arrest.

At the time of the search, police saw that a woman and her 2-year-old child were in the apartment at the time. Child Protective Services workers <a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/faq/removal-from-home.html" target="_blank">removed the child from the home</a> and placed the child elsewhere. Any time a child is found in a home where drugs are allegedly being sold, CPS is likely to—at least temporarily—remove the child from the home.
