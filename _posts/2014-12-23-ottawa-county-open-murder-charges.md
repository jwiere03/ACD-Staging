<h2>Coopersville Man Suspected of Killing Mother</h2>
Michael David Roersma, the 50-year-old Coopersville resident who reported his mother missing in September, has now been charged with open murder in her death. Â On top of killing her, he allegedly attempted to dispose of her body by dumping it in the Grand River.

72-year-old Sharon Roersma was beaten to death, according to the autopsy reports, and was apparently not in the water very long before she was discovered. Her body was found the same day by two men who were boating on the river in Polkton Township with the intention of catching a few fish. Instead they caught something far more grisly.

Michael Roersma, who is currently being held in the Ottawa County Jail on charges pertaining to controlled substances and probation violation, was apparently the police's number one suspect from the very beginning.

Although he initially denied having any knowledge of how his mother died, or how her body came to be in the river, he later admitted to police that he had put her body into a car, driven her down to the river's edge, and tossed her in. He also claimed that her death was caused by his having accidentally struck her with the basement door when he opened it.

In November Roersma was sentenced in the Ottawa County Circuit Court by Judge Jon Hulsing to 4-8 years in prison for violation of probation after a drug related conviction. While this is significantly higher than the sentencing guidelines suggest, the Judge explained that he had chosen this sentence because of Roersma's confession regarding his mother's body.

Open murder means that the prosecutor has not decided whether the charge should be first or second degree murder, and has left that decision up to the jury. <a title="Michigan 1st and 2nd Degree Murder Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">First degree murder</a> carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison, while second degree murder carries a penalty of any number of years up to life in prison.

In addition to the open murder charge, Roersma is also facing charges for lying to a peace officer, which is a felony punishable by up to 4 years in prison and possible fines of up to $5,000. Because Roersma has a lengthy criminal history with more than 20 convictions, he is also more likely to see an increased sentence for being a repeat offender.

A probable cause hearing on the open murder charge has been scheduled for January 8th in the murder case. Until then, Roersma will be held without bond at the Ottawa County Jail.
