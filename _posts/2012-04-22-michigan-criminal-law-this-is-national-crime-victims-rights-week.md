This week, April 22nd through April 28th, is National Crime Victim’s Rights Week. Each year, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC)—part of the United States Department of Justice—leads local communities in programming to promote victims’ rights. As <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/">criminal defense lawyers</a>, we are involved in the criminal justice system on a daily basis. We do appreciate the challenges and struggles that face victims of violent and non-violent crimes, and we are glad to see local communities paying attention to Michigan victims’ rights.

Michigan criminal laws pertaining to victims of crime are part of The William Van Regenmorter Crime Victim’s Rights Act. This legislation includes details such as: the victim’s right to give a statement to the court for the <a title="Sentencing Options in Michigan" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html">sentencing</a>, the victim’s entitlement to<a title="Restitution in Michigan" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/restitution.html"> restitution</a> from the offender, and the victim’s right to prompt return of property after it was used in a police investigation.
<h2>Why We Represent the People We do</h2>
We are often asked what it is like to represent people who have been charged with a crime. The truth is that we enjoy what we do and we have been <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Proven-Results.html">very successful</a> at it. Many people are victims of false allegations from former friends or spouses. One of our strategies may be to put into question the credibility of the complaining witness in a particular case. Other than false allegations, people find themselves wrongfully accused because of incorrect witness identification, unlawful police conduct, or incorrectly analyzed forensic evidence. We also know that each person in the United States is entitled to certain Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unconstitutional searches and seizures. We work to identify any such constitutional violations of our clients’ rights and may try to get illegal evidence gained suppressed in the Michigan court.

When choosing a Michigan criminal defense attorney, it is important to choose one who has gained knowledge through decades of successful criminal defense practice. You do not want to be your attorney’s first criminal case. There is a lot on the line, especially when charged with a felony. At The Kronzek Firm, we work tirelessly to defend all of our clients.
