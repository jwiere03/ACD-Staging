&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us here at The Kronzek Firm again for this series on fraud crimes in Michigan. So far we have discussed <a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-credit-card-fraud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit card fraud</a> and embezzlement, and what those charges mean here in the Great Lakes state. Moving on we are going to </span><b>unpack the subject of tax evasion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for you, and take a look at what that charge involves.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is tax evasion?</b></h2>
<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-tax-evasion-attorneys-failure-to-pay.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax evasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also sometimes called tax fraud, is quite simply, the illegal nonpayment or underpayment of taxes. In other words, </span><b>not paying the taxes that you are required to pay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the state of Michigan or the US government. Not paying your state or federal taxes is a crime, and if caught, you will likely face very serious criminal charges.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Is tax evasion the same as tax avoidance?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many people use the terms 'tax avoidance' and 'tax evasion' interchangeably, they are very different concepts. To put it in a nutshell, </span><b>tax avoidance is legal, while tax evasion is not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax avoidance is the legitimate minimizing of taxes, using methods that are approved by the IRS. For example, people and companies can avoid taxes by claiming legitimate deductions, setting up tax deferral plans, and </span><a href="https://www.midmichigandivorce.com/practice-areas/divorce-tax-impacts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of which are legal. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax evasion, on the other hand, is the illegal practice of </span><b>not paying taxes legally owed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is done by not reporting income, reporting expenses not legally allowed, or by not paying taxes owed.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What counts as tax evasion?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax evasion isn't one specific crime. Rather, it is a term that can refer to numerous different types of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of them pertaining to ways that a person </span><b>illegally avoids paying taxes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can be done in many different ways, including:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not filing an annual tax return</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underreporting your income</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claiming false deductions</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overstating expenses or deductions</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claiming personal expenses as business expenses</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing to collect and pay employment taxes</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violating employer withholding requirements</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making false statements to investigators</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are the penalties for tax evasion?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax evasion can be prosecuted either by the state of Michigan, or by the Federal government. Our state's criminal code has </span><b>different punishments for tax evasion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the feds do, so in order to answer this question, we have to give you two answers.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, failure to file a tax return, submitting a false tax return, payment with intent to defraud, aiding and abetting tax evasion, and filing false returns with intent to defraud are all felonies. If you're convicted of any of these crimes, you could face up to five years in prison, with fines of up to $5,000, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under federal law, an individual convicted of tax fraud is also facing up to five years in prison, but the </span><b>fines of up to $100,000 are significantly higher</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For a corporation faced with the same charges, the fines are raised to $500,000. An individual convicted of filing a false tax return could be sentenced to a maximum of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 year in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, $10,000 in fines, or both. A corporation guilty of this crime would have the fines increased to of $10,000.</span>

&nbsp;
