<h2>Home Invasion Incident Results in Felony Charges</h2>
According to police records, just before 11 pm on Monday, September 14th, Chris J. Shorkey broke into someone's apartment. While there, he allegedly bludgeoned someone with a handgun and threatened several others with it as well. After the assault, he drove away on a Harley Davidson, leaving the housemates to call 911.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">45-year-old </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio J. Smith told officers that he had been sitting on the couch, enjoying a beer, when Shorkey walked into his house with a gun and claimed that he was going to kill him . Apparently, he claimed that Smith had threatened his girlfriend. Shorkey is said to have hit Smith repeatedly with the butt of his gun and then left, returning again moments later to take Smith's cell phone before he could call 911.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Smith, he has not even seen Shorkey in over two years and never threatened his girlfriend. Smith's two roommates apparently told police similar versions of the events that transpired, and claimed that Shorkey had pointed the gun at them and threatened to kill them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Shorkey was finally arrested, he was arraigned on ten felony charges. He is currently charged with five counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felony firearm</a>, along with three counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">assault with a dangerous weapon</a>, and single counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank">armed robbery</a> and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">first degree home invasion</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, felony firearm still requires a mandatory two year prison sentence for each count, served consecutively to any other term, although legislators have already begun discussions about repealing this law. Assault with a dangerous weapon, also known as felonious assault, is punishable by up to four years in prison with fines of up to $2,000.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed robbery is a life offense under Michigan law, while first degree home invasion is punishable by a prison sentence of up to 20 years, and possible fines of up to $5,000. All things said and done, Shorkey is faced with some very serious charges.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorkey's preliminary examination began on September 29th in the District Court before Judge Mark E. Janer, Â but is now scheduled to continue on Tuesday, October 13th at 2:30pm. No information has been revealed yet regarding a plea offer from the prosecution, but it is likely that there will be one in the works.</span>
