As the government's "War on Drugs" wages on, police, prosecutors, and the Courts are taking harsher stances on drug crimes than ever before. Law enforcement officials are stepping up patrols, on the lookout for unlawful activity, including possessing, manufacturing, and distributing illicit drugs. One does not have to be an experienced defense lawyer in Michigan to know that possessing illegal narcotics can result in significant consequences, including fines and lengthy prison sentences. Such an example is seen in the recent arrest of two men in White Pigeon for possessing and manufacturing methamphetamine.
<h2>A Felony DrugÂ Crime in Michigan</h2>
Michigan State Police arrived at a White Pigeon residence on October 25th, with intentions of arresting an 18 year-old man on several outstanding warrants. When they arrived, police found two men sitting in a parked car outside the home--both the 18 year-old they were searching for, as well as a 39 year-old Bronson man, who was also wanted on a number of outstanding warrants in Michigan.

On further questioning and investigation, law enforcement at the scene searched the vehicle discovering a meth lab, as well as the components to manufacture the drug inside the car. Police immediately arrested the men, taking them to the local police station. While news sources failed to specify the exact charges pending against the younger man, the 39 year-old is charged with the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">possession and manufacture of methamphetamine</a>--both of which are very serious felony drug crimes in Michigan.

As a Schedule 2 drug, the penalties for conviction of a meth-related crime are severe. While many defendants receive prison time for Methamphetamine-related criminal activity, the severity of the punishment largely depends on which crime or the group of crimes a person is convicted of, along with the scoring of the Michigan Sentencing Guidelines.

<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">Possession of Methamphetamine</a> is a felony drug crime and a convicted violator could go to prison for up to ten years, pay a fine or $15,000 or both. Manufacturing meth is a more serious felony drug charge that can result in a longer prison sentence (up to 20 years), and a much larger fine. ($25,000).

These penalties do not include the other consequences that can befall a person convicted of meth-related crimes. It is also true that a person's driving privileges will be affected as well; even if the drug crime did not take place in a vehicle or while the offender was driving.

Michigan law takes a very harsh stance in regard to drug offenders, as evidenced by the serious penalties that a convicted violator may experience. As navigating state and Federal drug law is incredibly complex, it is essential that individuals accused of Methamphetamine-related criminal activity do not attempt to defend themselves.
