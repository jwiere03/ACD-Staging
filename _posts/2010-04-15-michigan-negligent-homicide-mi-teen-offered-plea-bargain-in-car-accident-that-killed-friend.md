Getting into a car accident is a devastating experience for everyone involved, especially for the victims and their families. Unfortunately, if a motorist crashes their vehicle killing a passenger, they could be prosecuted for life-changing crimes, such as negligent homicide--even if the driver was not under intoxicated by drugs or alcohol. These circumstances are similar to many clients helped by Michigan criminal defense lawyers, including a recent case where a teen has been slapped with serious criminal charges following a car accident, killing his friend in the passenger seat.

Around Christmas-time last year,  Anthony Sanders was driving his Chevy Lumina westbound along I-96 with a friend, Dominique Mitchell, 18. As two students at Eastern Michigan University, the two young men were traveling home for winter break to see their families for the holidays. According to police however, Sanders was driving close to 90 miles per hour when he lost control of his car, causing it to roll into the median, striking two other vehicles. The impact of the accident killed Mitchell at the scene, while police took Sanders into custody for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">Michigan negligent homicide charges.</a>
<h2>However, the Kent County Prosecutor's Office is planning on offering him a deal.</h2>
Because tests proved Sanders had no drugs or alcohol in his system at the time of the incident, and had no previous criminal record, the prosecutor's office plans to recommend no more than 90 days in jail. This is significantly less jail time, than the maximum sentence, which would lock up Sanders for two years.

As seen by the tragic example of Anthony Sanders and Dominique Mitchell, even getting into a horrifying and heart-wrenching accident may bring criminal charges on you. Negligent homicide charges will change your life forever, almost certainly resulting in jail time. Therefore, it is extremely important to contact experienced and trustworthy <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">criminal defense lawyers in Michigan</a>. Acting immediately will not only provide the highest quality legal advice and legal representation, but also help make sure that your case's outcome is positive.
