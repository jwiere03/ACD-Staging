33-year-old Matthew Lawrence Krueger is in a lot of trouble, and not just in one place either. Krueger is apparently facing a number of arson related charges in Oceana County in addition to a false threat of terrorism charge from Ottawa County. Apparently both sets of criminal activity took place on the same night in separate counties.<!--more-->

According to police records, Krueger was staying at a property in Golden Township which belonged to his parents. At about 4 am on February 8th, he allegedly set a fire which damaged the 12' x 12' living space located inside the structure that also housed vehicles. He is also accused of attempting to burn down a garage/workshop area located inside the same structure.

But unfortunately, it didn't end thereâ€¦.. on the same morning, just a couple of hours later, Krueger apparently called 911 to report a bomb threat against the Grand Haven Coast Guard station. He then crashed his pickup truck through the gates of the station, entered the building and then physically assaulted coast guard personnel.

While the criminal activities themselves may have only taken a few hours to do, they will result in many, many years behind bars if Krueger is convicted.

<h2>A false threat of terrorism charge is a 20 year felony</h2>

A false threat of terrorism charge is a 20 year felony under Michigan law, but smashing through the gates has resulted in a malicious destruction of personal property $1,000-$20,000 charge which could result in up to five years in prison.

With regards to the arson charges, he is facing either a first of a second degree arson charge, the first of which is punishable by up to life in prison and the later can be up to 20 years. In addition, Krueger has been charged with Arson - preparation to burn property valued at $20,000 or more, which is a 10 year felony, and Arson - preparation to burn a dwelling ( also a 10 year felony).

As Krueger is unable to retain his own attorney, he has been assigned an attorney by the court in each county. His Oceana County attorney has requested a mental competency hearing to determine whether or not he is able to understand the charges against him, and to assist in his own defense.
