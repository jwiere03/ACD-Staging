Emily Suzanne Smith, an 18-year-old resident of Haslett, is accused of having played a role in a recent Meridian Township shooting that took place on Labor Day.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At her most recent court appearance </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the 55th District Court in Mason</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Smith waived her preliminary hearing and was bound over for trial. She is charged with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">third-degree home invasion, felony firearm, discharging a firearm into an occupied building causing injury, and conspiracy to discharge a firearm into an occupied building causing injury.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Meridian Township Police who investigated the shooting, Smith and her boyfriend, 18-year-old </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Kahlke-Gerard, were both involved. The Meridian Township shooting incident apparently took place on September 7th, in the early hours of the morning, outside of a home on Piper Rd.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">47-year-old woman who lived there was apparently not the intended target, but was somehow shot in the process. The shooting itself, however, wasn't accidental or random, say police. Thankfully, the woman suffered only non-life threatening injuries, and was hospitalized for treatment.</span>


<h2>Was not made clear is the issue of why she was shot</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to law enforcement, the woman was inside her home when she was shot, but the gun was discharged outside. It has not been made public as to whether or not the woman was shot through a window, through a doorway, or even through a wall. Also not made clear is the issue of why she was shot. Police have revealed very little about their findings in this investigation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police arrested both Smith and Kahlke-Gerard. Smith was granted a conditional bond, which required that she wear a GPS tether upon release. She has posted bail and is currently free, while Kahlke-Gerard is still being held at the Ingham County Jail. He was granted a bond of $100,000, which has not yet been posted.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law third-degree <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">home invasion</a> is a felony punishable by up to five years and possible fines of $5,000, while <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felony firearm</a> requires a mandatory four year prison sentence. Discharging a firearm into an occupied building causing injury is also a felony, as is conspiracy to discharge a firearm into an occupied building causing injury.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge has ordered that Kahlke-Gerard undergo a competency evaluation. There is no word as of yet regarding the scheduled trial dates for Smith or her boyfriend.</span>
