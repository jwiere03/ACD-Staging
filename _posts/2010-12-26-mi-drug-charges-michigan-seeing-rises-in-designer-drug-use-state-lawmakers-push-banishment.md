However, this does not stop people from trying to get “high” while avoiding drug charges in the process.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In recent years, more people have been using analogue or designer drugs (which have a chemical make-up mimicking that of certain illegal drugs) in order to avoid the criminal charges associated with them. However, just because the analog drug seems like the real thing, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it will have the same effect. In 2010 alone, more than 60 people have been treated in Michigan hospitals after using K2, a synthetic form of marijuana banned by law enacted in November of 2010. Those who reported illness complained of symptoms including seizures, dizziness, trouble breathing or walking, vomiting, and a rapid heartbeat.</span>


<h2>Using that designer drug could face a misdemeanor drug charge</h2>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As if the health risks were not problematic enough, it is likely that more designer drugs will eventually become illegal under state law. Under the K2 ban, anyone convicted of using that designer drug could face a misdemeanor drug charge</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> accompanied with a hefty fine and jail time. <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/analogue-drugs.html" target="_blank">Manufacture, distribution or possession of analogue drugs</a>, however, are all felony drug offenses and therefore defendants convicted of those offenses could receive increased fines and longer prison sentences in Michigan Courts and the Federal Courts in Michigan.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Despite the risk of arrest in Michigan (and 14 other states nationwide), K2 and other analog drugs are still sold online and in stores as an incense and using other names such as “spice” or “summit.” In response to this, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA) recently announced their intent to ban numerous chemicals used to create designer drugs. State lawmakers have also expressed similar sentiments, making it a hot topic for discussion in the new year.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As seen by the quick action of lawmakers in Michigan and around the country, clearly synthetic drug charges will not be treated lightly by law enforcement, prosecutors, or the courts. If you have been accused in Michigan of a drug crime involving designer drugs or analogue drugs, it is important that you have the best legal advice and legal representation possible.
