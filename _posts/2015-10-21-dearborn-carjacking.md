<h2><b>4 Charged in Armed Carjacking at Dearborn McDonald's</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people, throughout the world, can say that they didn't get what they had hoped for during a recent trip to McDonalds. But for one particular woman, who was forced from her car at gunpoint while placing an order in the drive-thru, that doesn't begin to cover her early morning McDonald's experience.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the woman's testimony, she was pulling up to order food from a McDonald's in Dearborn, when three men materialized at her driver's side window. They pointed a gun at her and demanded that she get out of her 2006 Ford Fusion. As soon as she had stepped out of the car, the three men leapt into it and drove away.</span>

The stolen car was located some time later by the Detroit Police, who then notified the Dearborn Police of it's location. Officers from the Dearborn police department observed the vehicle and noted that the men inside matched the description provided by the carjacking victim.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers stopped the car and after a short foot chase, arrested the four men inside it. Jail records show that three were adults and one was a juvenile. The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office has recommended carjacking charges for three of them, named 19-year-old Charles Brown Jr., 17-year-old Dontrail Taylor, and 19-year-old Kortez Miller. All three young men are residents of Detroit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the arresting officers, the car the three men were driving around in belonged to the alleged victim. Along with the gun police believe was used during the carjacking, officers also found several other pieces of evidence allegedly linking the men to the crime.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The juvenile who was arrested is also being charged, although his charges are being handled by the juvenile court. His name is not being released due to his status as a minor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown is charged with two counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-financial-transaction-device-possession-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank">possessing a stolen financial transaction device</a>, and single counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-carjacking-attorneys-michigan-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">carjacking</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank">armed robbery</a>, unlawful driving away of automobile, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-receiving-concealing-attorneys-property-crimes-lawyers.html" target="_blank">receiving and concealing stolen property</a>, obstructing a police officer, and felony firearm.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor is charged with receiving and concealing stolen property, obstructing a police officer, and felony firearm. Miller is only facing one charge, namely receiving and concealing stolen property.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All three were arraigned in the 19th District Court, where Magistrate Doraid Elder set their conditional bonds at $75,000. Should they be released, they would be required to wear GPS tether monitoring anklets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A combined pre-trial hearing has been scheduled for 9 am on Friday, October 23rd.</span>
