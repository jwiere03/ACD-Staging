<h2>New Legislation Could Make Assaulting Sports Coach or Referee a Felony</h2>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Michigan Senate is currently in the process of considering a set of bills intended to enhance penalties for anyone charged with assaulting a sports coach or referee. And in the wake of 44-year-old John Bieniewicz's death last year, some feel that this couldn't happen soon enough.</span>

<!--more-->Bieniewicz died from a traumatic brain injury after being punched in the head by an irate soccer player on the field. According to witnesses, Bieniewicz was in the process of red carding a player who was facing his second violation during the game, when the player in question, <a title="Livonia Soccer Ref Death" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/livonia-soccer-ref-death.html" target="_blank">Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad</a>, punched him hard enough to knock him out and then ran from the field.

Saad is currently facing<a title="Michigan 1st and 2nd Degree Murder Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide" target="_blank"> second degree murder charges</a>, which could mean up to a lifetime in prison. But were he being charged under Senate Bills 31 and 32, there would be an added felony charge if the state adopts an assault law change.

This bill package, as introduced, would adapt the law covering assaults from a misdemeanor to a felony, when the assault involved referees or sport coaches. As it stands, this specific type of assault is punishable by 93 days in jail or a fine of $500. New legislation would make it a felony punishable by up to 3 years in prison and a possible fine of $10,000.

Among the group of sports officials who testified at the most recent Senate hearing, was Bieniewicz's wife, Kris Bieniewicz, who is a youth sports coach herself. She spoke in favor of the bill during her testimony, and shared the story of her family's loss.

She feels particularly strongly about the subject, she explained, because her son has expressed a desire to follow in his father's footsteps and become a soccer ref. "I'm not losing a second family member to somebody's stupidity out on the soccer field, and if there's something out there that can deter these people from doing something that stupid, all because of a game, we need to have it done," she said.

Senators in favor of the bills spoke about how increased penalties would deter future aggression during sporting events, and it was even suggested that signs be hung up at games reminding players of the increased sanctions. But not everyone agreed.

Senator Patrick Colbeck disagreed with the bills, saying that assault is assault, no matter what your job is. He expressed concern over highlighting a person's career when pressing charges, saying that laws are meant to benefit everyone equally.

The bills were not voted on during this committee hearing, and will most likely be further modified before being once again reviewed and considered in the next few weeks.
