The National Governors Association has chosen four states to explore changes to the juvenile justice system. These states are Michigan, Indiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The purpose is to improve outcomes for children while increasing community safety in the process.<!--more-->

The four teams over the next few months will make recommendations to their states about youth policies. The topics include: how information is shared across the system; how children who are not high-risk can reduce their contact with courts; and an expansion of local alternatives to locking kids up. The goal here is to reduce rates of individuals committing crimes again, lower state costs, and make the streets safer for residents.

The acting director of the program for the Michigan Department of Human Services pointed out that there has already been a serious statewide effort to help these at-risk youth.


<h2>Efforts are being made to change zero-tolerance laws</h2>


For instance, grants have been provided to rural areas for programs to keep youth at home instead of going to jail or detention. This School-Justice Partnership project stops teens from falling into the system and avoiding the related pitfalls. In addition, efforts are being made to change zero-tolerance laws that cause unfair school expulsions for low-risk offenses. By avoiding this, young people can avoid a path that frequently, over time, ends with prison. These youth can then be future contributors to Michigan's economy and continued bettering of the state.

Some features of the study include: many networking options; expert technical help on the project; identifying and developing recommendations for the governors of their home states.

Such a project is exciting because it could produce many great ideas that could lead to important reforms. In the months to come, it will be interesting to revisit this topic and see what is finally proposed to state leaders.

The <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank">attorneys of The Kronzek Firm PLC</a> applaud the National Governors Association for this initiative. Â  We look forward to seeing what the four teams come up with to change our communities for the better.
