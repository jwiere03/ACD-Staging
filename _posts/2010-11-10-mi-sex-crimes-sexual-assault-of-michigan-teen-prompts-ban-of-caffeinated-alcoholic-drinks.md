Each day Michigan defense lawyers represent clients in cases where a person is accused of forcing another to engage in sexual activity against their will. In many of these, alcohol use is commonly involved–by both victims and defendants. In Michigan it is illegal to have sexual contact with an incapacitated person. While the booze is generally found in the form of liquor or beer, recent cases have reported sexual assaults taking place after consuming alcoholic energy drinks sold in local grocery stores across the state.


<h2>Two other 16 year-old boys will be charged as juveniles</h2>


According to the Detroit Free Press, a Melvindale teen told authorities that she consumed Four Loko, a popular alcoholic caffeine drink, before she was sexually assaulted last month. The defendants in this case were all charged with criminal offenses, including 17 year-old Tra-von Hampton, who was arraigned on a charge of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Two other 16 year-old boys will be charged as juveniles for sex offenses committed against the teen girl. Regardless of the defendant's age, conviction of any sexual conduct crime carries significant and permanent consequences, including possible jail or prison time and listing on the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-offender-registry.html" target="_blank">Michigan Sex Offender Registry</a>.

The Four Loko drink is said to be the equivalent of four cups of coffee and four beers, which can significantly impair a person’s ability to reason and act logically. Health advocates, including Wayne State University's Dr. Tsveti Markova, say that the energy drinks are dangerous because they contain both stimulants and depressants. "The caffeine blocks the effect of the alcohol so you don't feel like you're becoming drunk and in many cases, people consume more," explained Dr. Markova. "Once the caffeine wears out, there's just the alcohol effect, and people realize they've consumed quite a bit." Various state and federal agencies are considering measures to regulate or ban the use of this type of product. As a result of sexual assault cases (such as the one described above) and at the urging of health and safety advocates, the Michigan Liquor Control Commission has banned the Four Loko drink, along with 55 other energy beverages containing alcohol. Citing safety reasons and the concern for use by teenagers, the commission is giving manufacturers 30 days to remove the drinks from all store shelves statewide. The board members hope that making these drinks unavailable will help prevent future sex crime cases from occurring.

Being accused of a sex crime is a scary experience for anyone to go through, whether the incident in question involved alcohol or not. A Conviction would affect both your personal freedom and your reputation, possibly resulting in prison time, fines, probation, and even inclusion on the Michigan Sex Offender Registry or the requirement that you wear a GPS tether for the rest of your life.
