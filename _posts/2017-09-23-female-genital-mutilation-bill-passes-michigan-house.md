&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The subject of female genital mutilation is one that has received a lot of air time in Michigan this year. Several instances of this child abuse have been discovered and investigated in </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Detroit area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently.  This lead to </span><b>criminal charges and CPS involvement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for numerous families and individuals. This subject has been a hot button here in the Great Lakes State. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who may not be familiar with the details of these horrifying cases so far, here is a quick recap of events:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">44-year-old Jumana Nagarwala of Northville, who formerly practiced emergency medicine at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, has confessed to </span><b>performing genital cuttings on two young girls from Minnesota</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The girls explained during interviews with Homeland Security agents and CPS workers, that they had been taken to 'the doctor', where they lay on an examination table while Nagawala performed the mutilation. One young girl described the pain as excruciating, and said that she could hardly sit afterwards. Nagarwala had bond set at $4 million dollars because the federal court feared that she would flee the United States. She must also wear a GPS tether during her pretrial release. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the first two child victims shared their experience with authorities, other victims have been located. It was also later discovered that </span><b>Nagarwala was not alone in performing the mutilation procedures</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to a </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/957381/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit, Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, 53, of Farmington Hills, and his wife were also present when the procedures were performed. Dr. Attar is also the owner of the clinic where the young girls were brought to be mutilated and cut.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of these allegations have been </span><b>ruinous for everyone involved</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition to the loss of their respective jobs, and the criminal charges brought against them, there is the issue of their children. The accused, who come from both Wayne and Oakland counties, are facing </span><a href="http://childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/practice-areas/termination-of-parental-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">termination of their parental rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their own children. This means that not only could their children be removed by CPS, but that they might no longer have any rights to those children if their rights are terminated by a Michigan family court judge. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three adults have also since been charged with Performing Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) on Minors. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Female genital mutilation has been illegal under federal law in the United States since 1996. However, in 2013 </span><b>that law was amended to include what is sometimes called "vacation cutting"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which refers to taking a minor out of the country to have the practice performed in another country. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the US outlaws this practice, Michigan didn't have a specific law on the books at the time. This was quickly rectified in the wake of the cases being made public. A number of bills were introduced, making FGM in any format a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 year felony in Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and were pushed through the House and Senate with unprecedented speed, </span><b>receiving wide bipartisan support</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They were signed into law by Governor Snyder in early July.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the new laws made FGM illegal in Michigan and outlined the harsh penalties involved, there was </span><b>no mention made of what would happen to the victims</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or even whether or not the parents who had advocated for FGM for their daughters would have sustained contact with their children after the fact. Michigan House Representative Peter Lucido is hoping to change that. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucido has crafted a bill that would have serious repercussions for </span><b>families who allow their daughters to undergo any form of FGM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Lucido, "We are in America, We are not in a foreign country." The bill, which passed the House on Thursday, would </span><a href="https://childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/practice-areas/termination-of-parental-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">take away the parental rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of anyone who allowed a physicians to perform female genital mutilation on their daughter/s. House Bill 4716 passed 89-16 in the House, and now heads to the Senate for consideration.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This situation is a classic example of how difficult and confusing it can be when one person’s cultural or religious beliefs collide with another’s. What is viewed as acceptable, or even necessary, in one part of the world, </span><b>may be considered a crime in another part</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
