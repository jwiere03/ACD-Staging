&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to our talk about </span><b>what parents can do if their child is arrested in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It's a hard topic to discuss, we know (we're parents ourselves, remember!) But it's important, because when you get that call, you need to be prepared! In our previous article we shared the first 4 tips we think are most important if your child gets arrested. But that wasn't sall you need to know! There's quite a bit more. So let's get started.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Now that you've got the details and called a lawyer...</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you followed our pointers from last time, you would have </span><b>spoken to your child</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, advised them not to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">admit anything to anyone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to stay quiet and behave, and then called an attorney. So what now?</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3><b> Give the attorney as much information as you can</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to start </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/hyta-sentencing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building a good defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your child, the attorney you hired is </span><b>going to need lots of information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That means, everything your child shared with you over the phone, and more! Make sure you pass along everything to the attorney as quickly as possible. Right from the get-go, your child's lawyer will need to know the following:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your child's name and age</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where your child is being held</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they were arrested for</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where they were arrested and by whom (which law enforcement department)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long has it been since they were arrested</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who they've spoken to, and what they said</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not have all of this information yet. Don't worry. Your attorney can get it. However, the more details you have to start with, the </span><b>better equipped your criminal lawyer will be</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they show up at the jail to represent your child.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Be prepared to work with your child's attorney</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from all of the initial info your child's attorney will need just to get started, they are going to need help from you for other things as well. Your child may need </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">character witnesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whose names you can provide. If your child is taking </span><b>any kind of medication that may affect their decision making capabilities or impulse control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you'll need to tell their lawyer. The same goes for any mental health diagnosis your child may have that could affect their case.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3><b> Gather documentation that could help your child</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Only your child's attorney will know exactly what may help their case, but it can't hurt for you to be prepared. Collect any certificates or awards that could attest to your child's achievements. Have </span><b>family, friends, and even teachers write character reference letters</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gather up report cards and other paperwork documenting your child's education. You never know what may be helpful. And when </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/john-m-english.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asks for something, having it immediately available will speed the process significantly!</span>
