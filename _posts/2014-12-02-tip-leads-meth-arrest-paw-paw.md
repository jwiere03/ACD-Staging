Detectives from the Narcotics Division of the Van Buren County Sheriff's Office received a tip recently that pointed them in the direction of a man named Troy Strouse. He was apparently purchasing items used in the production of methamphetamine. <!--more-->
<h2>Surveillance Leads to Search and Arrest</h2>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">They began a surveillance on his vehicle and passed on the information to other deputies out on patrol. A traffic stop was conducted on South Kalamazoo Ave. in Paw Paw, which was when the deputies discovered there was a warrant out for Strouse's arrest for failing to appear in court.</span>

The vehicle was searched after Strouse was taken into custody. The officers found the meth lab components that had initiated the tip to police in the first place. Detectives then searched Strouse's home, where they discovered two one-pot meth labs, meth oil, meth smoking paraphernalia, and HCL gas generators that had been used for meth production in the garage.

Strouse however, who was by now in the Van Buren County Jail, had a whole different set of problems to deal with. Deputies at the jail discovered that he had even more methamphetamine  related paraphernalia hidden on his person: two vials - one containing meth residue and one containing a substance suspected to be meth - along with a smoking straw. It was not revealed exactly where these items were concealed.

According to police, Strouse is currently under arrest exclusively for the outstanding warrant which was issued in Kalamazoo County. He has not yet been charged with any of the meth arrest related charges as the investigation is ongoing. However, officers say that they intend to forward all of the information to the Prosecutor's Office, requesting charges for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">possession of methamphetamine</a>, smuggling contraband into a jail facility, operating/maintaining a meth lab, and maintaining a drug house.

As of now the only charge Strouse is looking at is that of failure to appear. This could be either a misdemeanor or a felony, depending upon what the original charges were for, and therefore could result in fines and possible jail or even prison time. It will also mean that in future, a court will be less likely to allow Strouse to post bail after an arrest.
