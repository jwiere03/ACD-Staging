<h2><b>New Legislation aims to Revamp Poaching Penalties</b></h2>
Poaching. It's a problem that every state in the country, indeed almost every country in the world, has to face. The word "poaching" tends to conjure images of elephants, rhinos and other iconic African animals. However, Michigan is equally affected by the unlicensed and illegal killing of it's natural wildlife.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this particular issue, Michigan lawmakers are currently discussing whether or not to increase the state's poaching penalties. A bill package is presently making its way through the Michigan Legislature. It aims to address these issues by increasing the fines poachers would be forced to pay. In addition, the new law would lengthen the duration of hunting license suspensions for convicted poachers.</span>

Currently, Michigan law fines a convicted poacher $1,500 for every bear, elk, and moose illegally killed in the wild. The new laws would change that amount to $5,000 for elk and moose, and $3,500 for bear. And these aren't the only animals that the new laws would include in penalty hikes. Eagles, hawks, turkeys, and waterfowl poaching would also be subject to steep increases in fines.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to lengthened hunting license suspensions, current law allows for a three year suspension for violation, regardless of how many times an individual is convicted of the same offense. Changes to the law would allow for significant increases in these time periods, and even longer periods for repeat offenders. For example, poaching an elk or moose would result in a 15 year suspension for a first-time offender. A repeat offender would lose their hunting license permanently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Poaching is not just limited to out-of-season hunting. It also refers to hunting at night with electronic devices and even the hunting of animals that are legally protected. It can have a drastic effect on population control for animals whose populations are struggling, like the moose; currently declining in numbers in Michigan.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, poaching makes it difficult for wildlife agencies to respond to the ever-evolving difficulties facing animal populations, like harsh winters and low reproductive rates. For this reason several legislators, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senators John Proos and Geoff Hansen, have chosen to co-sponsor this bill.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, nothing is set in stone, but the bill appears to have received no major opposition so far. It remains to be seen what will come of this in the future.</span>
