&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a question our criminal defense attorneys get asked a lot. </span><b>What is the difference between Domestic Violence and Assault?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is there even a difference in Michigan? And if so, how could it affect me? We understand that this can be a confusing subject. So we've decided to break it down for you in the hopes of making things a little easier to understand. Here goes…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Domestic Violence:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestic Violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is also known as Domestic Assault, is defined as any form of </span><b>domestic violence done to any person who is in a domestic relationship with you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This could include any kind of assault or battery. In fact,the victim doesn't even need to be injured for prosecutors to bring a domestic assault charge against you. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationship</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between the alleged assailant and the alleged victim is what defines this charge.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Domestic violence charges fall into two categories in Michigan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Domestic Assault and Aggravated Domestic Assault. The difference is that domestic assault is any form of assault or battery of the victim and could result in misdemeanor charges punishable by up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine. Aggravated Domestic Assault is the charge used when </span><b>the victim is harmed badly enough to need medical attention</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the violence didn't involve a weapon. This would be charged also as a misdemeanor but the jail time would be increased to 1 year and the fines would be $1,000.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Assault:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault, without the 'domestic' attachment, refers to any act of violence, or imminent violence against another person who isn't in a relationship with the assailant. In Michigan there are several ways that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be charged.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Simple Assault: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This refers to the basic crime of assaulting or battering someone. If someone assaults, or assaults and batters another person, this is charged as a misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to 93 days in jail, a possible $500 fine, or both.</span>

<b>Aggravated Assault: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aggravated assault is defined as battery with an aggravated injury. Similar to simple assault, this charge doesn't include the use of a weapon and so is still charged as a misdemeanor. It is  punishable by up to 1 year in jail, with a fine of $1,000, or both.</span>

<b>Felonious Assault: </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felonious Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to assault that involved the use of a dangerous weapon. However, isn't limited to only a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a knife or brass knuckles. Numerous things can qualify as dangerous weapons if they can be used to harm someone else. A beer bottle, a glass ashtray and even tools can count as dangerous weapons. This charge is a felony under Michigan law and is punishable by up to four years in prison and fines of up to $2,000, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

Michigan law includes several other assault charges that are much more serious. Assault with Intent to do Great Bodily Harm Less Than Murder and Assault with Intent to Commit Murder are both felonies that are punished very harshly<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
