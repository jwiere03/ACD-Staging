&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You wouldn't hand your credit card over to a stranger would you? Of course not! But waitâ€¦.. you might have already done exactly that, and you just didn't know about it. In other words, you may have been skimmed! Skimming devices, which are attached by criminals to ATMs and gas pumps, </span><b>"skim" your credit card information and save it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that a stranger can </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-cancelled-revoked-financial-transaction-device.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">go shopping with your line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, this is happening more and more nowadays, with skimmer devices showing up all over Michigan on </span><b>ATMs, gas pumps, Redbox movie rental kiosks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even in the hands of store clerks and wait staff at restaurants. It has become such an issue here in Michigan, that the Senate has introduced SB 415, which outlines the extra precautions that gas stations would be required to take in order to protect customers from skimming.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then, however, what can you do about it? The answer: LOTS! While </span><b>you can't effectively stop using your debit or credit cards</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> altogether, (unless you want to revert to a cash only financial system, which can be limiting and time consuming) there are </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-check-fraud-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steps you can take to protect yourself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>ATMs</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always take a moment to look critically at the ATM before using it - if any part of it looks different, suspicious, or tampered with in any way, </span><b>do not use it and contact your bank to report your suspicions immediately</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because a skimmer captures your card information, but would need a PIN number as well in order to use your debit card, thieves often mount tiny cameras on or near the ATM to capture your PIN as you enter it. Pay attention to your surroundings and take note of any suspicious items on nearby magazine racks or on the ATM itself.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While punching in your PIN, </span><b>cover your hand with your wallet or a piece of paper</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to block the view of any hidden cameras in the vicinity.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to keep a regular check on your account - read all of your bank statements and, if possible, </span><b>keep track of your transaction history online</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Report any account activity that wasn't generated by you or your financial institution.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>GAS PUMPS</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at all possible, pay inside rather than paying at the pump - unattended gas pumps are much </span><b>easier for thieves to tamper with</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the credit card reader inside the store.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be attentive to the credit card reader inside the store as well - especially if it is a wireless card reader</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to pay at the pump, look carefully at the gas pump you are using before sliding your card, and even at the pumps around you to be sure that the credit card slot on yours looks identical in every way. </span><b>Report any apparent tampering or visible differences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the gas station attendant and the police.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>PROTECT YOURSELF</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check all of your accounts daily to be sure that you have not fallen victim to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/retail-crime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit card theft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>report ANY unusual account activity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your financial institution.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry cash for those instances where you are not certain of your card's safety and would rather not take the risk, like paying for gas at a convenience store, or paying for a meal in a restaurant.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be attentive to your surroundings and to any and all devices where you intend to use your card - sometimes you can save yourself from becoming a victim by simply </span><b>paying close attention and not using your card</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you are in any way suspicious or unsure.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report any suspected skimming devices you encounter to the police immediately - credit card skimming is illegal and causes many people to lose vast sums of money that they are often unable to recover.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Skimmers have become more and more sophisticated with the passage of time. Some of them so </span><b>well disguised and seamlessly integrated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that even the pros don't notice them. If you would like to read an indepth article on what skimming devices look like (there are many!) KrebsonSecurity has a very comprehensive </span><a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/all-about-skimmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article on skimming devices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is both educational and terrifying.</span>
