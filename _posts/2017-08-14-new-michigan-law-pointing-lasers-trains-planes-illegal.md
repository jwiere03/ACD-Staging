&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early May of this year, Michigan </span><b>Governor Rick Snyder signed a bill into law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that addressed the issue of lasers, planes and trains. Nope, you're thinking of that goofy 80's movie </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093748/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is something completely different. (And far more serious!)</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It all began in February of this year. Several different </span><b>helicopter and airplane pilots reported being temporarily blinded</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while flying over western Oakland County and the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The culprit? Ground-based directed energy devices, which is the fancy way of saying laser beams held by people standing on the ground, pointing them up at the sky. Yes, those are those little laser pointers that lots of kids all over Detroit have. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to what many perceived as </span><b>a real threat to people's lives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, State Representative Tom Barrett introduced a bill that would make pointing a laser at a plane (or any other airborne vehicle) and trains </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">illegal here in Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His efforts were partnered by Representative Laura Cox, who also introduced a bill addressing the same questionable conduct.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills received significant support, especially after The Michigan State Police testified before the House Law and Justice Committee about </span><b>an MSP helicopter and three other aircraft that had all been struck by a laser</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the same day.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In speaking to the media about the new laser law, Cox said that "This law addresses a growing public safety issue. </span><b>It may seem harmless from the ground</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to point a laser pointer you got at a hardware store at a helicopter, but there’s the possibility of a pilot or a train conductor being temporarily blinded. It’s a danger to anyone in the paths of the planes and trains."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Snyder signed House Bill 4063 into law in May, making it </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2017-2018/publicact/htm/2017-PA-0029.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Act No. 29</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and after a 90 day waiting period, the law went into effect just a few days ago. It is now officially illegal here in Michigan to </span><b>point a laser of any kind at a train, an airplane, a helicopter, or any other type of aircraft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anyone accused of doing so will be charged with a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, a fine of $10,000, or both.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is already illegal under federal law to point a laser at any aircraft.</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is apparently a problem that seems to be </span><b>growing with every passing year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When addressing the the House Law and Justice Committee, Barrett, who serves as a helicopter pilot in the Michigan National Guard, said that there was nothing he could think of that was </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/court-appointed-attorneys"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more dangerous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than blinding a person who was at the controls of an aircraft or a train, even for a few seconds.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another piece of information that Barrett shared was the fact that in 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration reported </span><b>more than 3,800 laser pointer to aircraft incidents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The number had grown since then. "The reports of aircraft being struck by these directed energy devices is only increasing, as is the possibility of a catastrophic accident affecting passengers and people on the ground." Barrett said in a media release.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We highly recommend to all of our readers that they be very careful when playing with laser beams. Even </span><b>harmless play can result in tragedy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when not carefully managed. Also, we suggest that you discuss this with your children, as this is the kind of horsing around that would likely appeal to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/category/juvenile-crime/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teenagers who do not fully understand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the gravity of the situation and the possible outcome.</span>
