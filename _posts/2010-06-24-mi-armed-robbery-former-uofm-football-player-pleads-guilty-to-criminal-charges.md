When experienced Michigan criminal defense attorneys have offices near large universities and colleges they are likely to represent students, including collegiate athletes, in criminal cases. Should the defendant be convicted, severe consequences will undoubtedly follow such as expulsion from school or even jail time. For university athletes, a guilty verdict can dash the hopes of a promising pre-professional career. It happened just this week when a former University of Michigan football player pled guilty to a variety of criminal charges in Washtenaw County.

Five months after receiving the boot from the school football team due to regulation violations, former U of M cornerback Boubacar Cissoko admitted to going on a crime spree throughout the Ann Arbor area. According to law enforcement officials, the ex-football player stole cash from three separate deliverymen as they made change for his purchase. Additionally, Cissoko was accused of Michigan armed robbery charges after robbing a taxi cab driver by putting a pellet gun in his face.

In court last Wednesday, Cissoko pled guilty to a lesser charge of assault with intent to rob. Although in the eyes of the court this is not considered as severe of a crime as the original charges, the punishment is still onerous; assault with intent to rob carries a 15 year sentence. The former football player also admitted to three counts of larceny for the cash stolen from local food deliverymen. As a result, Cissoko may face 45 years behind bars for all the violations against him.

<h2>Defendants routinely serve these sentences simultaneously</h2>

Despite the lengthy prison term pending for Cissoko, The Detroit News maintains that the actual sentence will be a lot shorter. "Defendants routinely serve such sentences simultaneously, rather than consecutively -- especially when they plead guilty," wrote reporter Gregg Krupa. However, this is just speculation until Cissoko is sentenced on August 10th by Judge Archie Brown.

As seen by the example of Boubacar Cissoko, being accused of criminal charges is a difficult experience for anyone to go through, regardless of age or status. Conviction of armed robbery or larceny can have serious consequences for a defendant, likely leading to jail or prison time.
