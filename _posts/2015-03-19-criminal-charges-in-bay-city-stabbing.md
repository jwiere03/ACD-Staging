<h2><b>Bay City Stabbing a Strange Case</b></h2>
Police were recently dispatched to a home where a woman had apparently broken in and then proceeded to fight with her ex husband who lived inside. She punched him and stabbed him, and now, as a result, is facing criminal charges. But the story is actually a little stranger than the usual assault case.<!--more-->

According to Curtis Thompson, who has been divorced from Shirletha Thompson for over a decade, his ex wife arrived at his home and pounded on his door, demanding to be let in. Curtis chose not to open the door, and so Shirletha forced her way into the house by breaking glass in either the door or a nearby window.

At this point, Curtis apparently yelled at her to get out, but she refused and the two became involved in a physical fight. Both claim that the other threw the first punch, so that part of the story is not clear, but both admitted to punching the other.

But then, Shirletha left the room to retrieve a knife from the kitchen. While she was gone, Curtis called 911 to report the incident but, while still on the phone, Shirletha returned and stabbed him in the bicep.

By the time police arrived, Curtis and Shirletha were rolling around on the blood-soaked bed, in the blood splattered room, fighting. Curtis was able to restrain her and hold her down until police arrived and were able to cuff her.

Shirletha immediately admitted to police what had happened, but her explanations had an interesting religious twist. She claimed to have arrived and known that Curtis had another woman inside the house with him, which made her mad. She admitted to breaking into the house, but claimed that she was punched as soon as she entered.

She told police that she recalled getting a knife but then has no memory of what she may have done with it, explaining that she blacks out when she's stressed. She said that she must have stabbed him, but had no memory of the event. Every explanation, however, was completed with the words: "God is my savior. He will protect me!"

However, minutes later, when the police had moved on to asking others about the sequence of events, Shirletha continued talking to herself about what had happened, saying, "Yep, I broke in. Yep, I stabbed his ass. ... He wants to bring another female over here. Yep, I sure as hell broke in. God is my savior. He will protect me."

Shirletha was arraigned on single counts of <a title="first degree home invasion" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/home-invasion-1st-degree-michigan-home-invasion-attorneys" target="_blank">first-degree home invasion </a>and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-assault-dangerous-weapon-attorneys" target="_blank">assault with a dangerous weapon</a>, both of which are very serious felony charges. She was also charged with a single count of misdemeanor <a title="domestic violence" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault" target="_blank">domestic violence</a>. Her bond was set at $75,000, and her preliminary exam in this Bay City stabbing incident has been scheduled for April 1st.
