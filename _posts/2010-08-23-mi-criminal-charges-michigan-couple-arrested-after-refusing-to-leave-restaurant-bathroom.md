Just like a small child misbehaving, acting inappropriately in a public place can land a person in a whole mess of trouble. Should law enforcement officials be alerted to your out-of-line behavior, it is possible that you could face serious consequences including criminal charges and even jail time. Throughout the career of experienced criminal lawyers in Michigan, it is common to see outrageous cases involving persons who are arrested for acting out in public. However, a recent example of a Flint couple arrested after refusing to leave a restaurant bathroom may be a first.
<h2>Flint Restaurant Disturbance Leads To Altercation</h2>
Last Friday, law enforcement officials were alerted to a disturbance at a Flint restaurant on S. Saginaw Street. According to restaurant management, a couple locked themselves in the bathroom. Most of the staff alleged that the two were having intercourse in the bathroom. Despite the restaurant employee's best efforts to get the couple to leave, they had no success.

When the police finally arrived, they tried to ask the two to leave the bathroom. At this time, the couple became "irate and belligerent in public." Both individuals attempted to resist arrest, and the female suspect allegedly assaulted an officer in the altercation. Although it is unknown whether the two were intoxicated at the time, both were arrested by police for various criminal charges. Officers booked the woman for resisting arrest and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">assault charges in Michigan</a>, while the man was charged with attempting to interfere with police.
