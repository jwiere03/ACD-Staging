A criminal defense attorney from Stanton, Michigan was recently jailed for contempt of court in Ottawa County. He was at the 58th District Court in Hudsonville representing a client who was charged with Minor in Possession. The judge asked the client whether the client had previously used controlled substances, and the attorney instructed the client to protect his Fifth Amendment <a title="Miranda Rights" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html">right to remain silent</a>. 

<h2>This District Court Judge disapproved of the attorneyâ€™s instruction and sent the attorney to the Ottawa County jail. </h2>The attorney was released from the jail later that same afternoon when a higher judge ordered his release. The matter is still pending in the Ottawa County Circuit Court.
