<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the previous article we talked about the difference between Domestic Violence and Assault in Michigan. We also discussed three of the ways that Criminal Assault can be charged, namely Simple Assault, Aggravated Assault and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felonious Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, </span><b>those are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to possible assault charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So in this next segment we break down some of the other options you may encounter here in the Great Lakes State.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Assault with Intent to do Great Bodily Harm Less Than Murder</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this charge has a very long name it is sometimes referred to as "</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault GBH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">." The GBH stands for "great bodily harm." </span><b>This charge is used when someone has assaulted another person with the intention of doing great bodily harm, but not murder</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This charge is a felony, and a person convicted of Assault GBH here in Michigan can be punished with up to 10 years in prison, or a fine of up to $5,000.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Assault with Intent to Commit Murder</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaulting another person with the intention of murdering them is a felony in Michigan. Anyone convicted of "AWIM" can be punished with a sentence of up to life in prison. As with an "Assault GBH" charge, </span><b>the factor that determines the severity of the punishment is the alleged intent of the defendant.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In this case the prosecutor would have to prove to the court that the defendant intended to murder the person they were assaulting.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Assaulting, Battering, Resisting, Obstructing, or Opposing a Police Officer Performing a Duty</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This charge is often called “</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-resisting-obstructing-attorneys-resisting-arrest-assaulting-police-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resisting and Obstructing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or “R and O” in Michigan. It can be used in a number of different scenarios, including resisting arrest, refusing to follow an order given by a police officer, or </span><b>harming an officer while they are working</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This charge is a felony and is taken very seriously by prosecutors offices throughout Michigan. It is punishable by up to 2 years in prison, a fine up to $2,000.00, or both. However, if the officer is badly harmed or even killed as a result, the penalties can be enhanced.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Assault with Intent to Rob and Steal, Armed</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This charge refers to a situation where someone assaulted another individual as part of an attempt to commit an armed robbery or theft. </span><b>Michigan law described "armed" in this case as the individual being armed with anything that could be used as a dangerous weapon.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The person in question does not have to use the weapon, they simply have to have it on their person at the time and make it known that they are armed. This is a felony punishable by up to life in prison, or any number of years.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>There are numerous other options for Assault charges in Michigan, including:</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault with intent to rob and steal, unarmed</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault with intent to commit any other type of felony</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault with intent to maim</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torture</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threatening or assaulting a CPS worker</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assaulting or battering an employee or contractor of public utility company</span></li>
</ul>
