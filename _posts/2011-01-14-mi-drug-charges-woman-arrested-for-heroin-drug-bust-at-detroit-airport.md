As the American government continues to actively pursue illegal drug activity in the United States, it is common for top criminal lawyers to represent people who have been arrested for a variety of drug crimes. Among the most serious of these offenses are the movement and distribution of illegal narcotics and other drugs. Although most defendants accused of transporting drugs are caught while driving, there are examples of individuals busted with drugs while attempting to use other modes of transportation. In a recent case, Customs and Border Protection officials arrested a woman at Detroit Metropolitan Airport after security discovered that she was carrying a massive amount of Heroin pellets inside her body.

<h2>Lamidi admitted that she was transporting narcotics</h2>

After displaying suspicious behavior during a flight from Europe to Metro Detroit, a Customs agent flagged 32 year-old Sherifat Lamidi for closer investigation. During questioning, Lamidi admitted that she was transporting narcotics, but insisted that she did not know what drug she was carrying or how much. Doctors at a medical facility extracted the narcotics from the woman's system, discovering an astonishing 91 pellets of Heroin, equaling almost two and a half pounds.

Almost immediately, law enforcement officials arrested Lamidi and charged her with Heroin-related crimes, which are among the most serious of drug charges. Under Michigan law, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank">Heroin possession, manufacture, creation, and delivery</a> are each felony drug crimes, and they all carry lengthy prison sentences and excessive fines. There are also other circumstances—such as committing the Heroin crime near a school or having a prior Heroin conviction—that could make the consequences even more severe. The offender will also lose some of his or her driving privileges.

Being arrested for a drug-related crime is a traumatic and horrifying experience for anyone to go through, regardless of the quantity of drugs discovered.
