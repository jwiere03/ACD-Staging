<h2><b>Burger King Employee Assaulted</b></h2>
As was made painfully clear by the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bacon-worth-going-to-prison-over.html">bacon-inspired shooting</a> at McDonalds just a few months ago in Grand Rapids, fast food jobs can in fact be more dangerous than you'd think. So perhaps it should come as less of a surprise to discover that another violent outburst at a fast food restaurant has resulted in criminal charges. This time at a Burger King in Pittsfield Township.<!--more-->

According to Gordy Schick, the Deputy Chief of the Pittsfield Township police, a local 18-year-old man was arrested last month after physically assaulting a Burger King employee. Why? Well, no one seems entirely sure. But it has been suggested that the argument was a result of being denied free food.

Police say it happened like this:

One of the Burger King employees, a 30-year-old Ypsilanti Township man, was on his break when a young man began an argument with him. The man apparently also threatened a female coworker, and then demanded that the fight be continued outside.

The Burger King employee, in an attempt to defuse the situation, escorted the angry young man off the premises. But the young man had no intentions of leaving without a fight. While they were leaving, he turned suddenly and punched the employee in the face. The older man was knocked to the ground, and the younger man then proceeded to punch and kick him while he was on the ground.

The young man then fled the scene on foot, but was caught by Pittsfield Township officers responding to alerts about the fight. The Burger King employee was given medical attention for the wounds he sustained, and then taken to a local hospital. Police say that the damage done to his face was quite severe.

The 18-year-old man was arrested and transported to jail. Perhaps once more details have been released regarding this case, we will discover exactly what it was that started the fight in the first place. He could potentially be facing aggravated assault charges.

Under Michigan law, for someone to be charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">aggravated assault</a>, their attack on someone must fit the law's definition of assault, plus causing serious injury. If convicted, an individual could spend up to a year in jail and pay a fine of up to $1,000. <b></b>
