Practicing near the capitol of Michigan, aggressive Lansing criminal defense lawyers often see cases of political figures accused of a variety of criminal charges. For these individuals, being suspected of a criminal violation is a strenuous and difficult process as their reputation and job are almost certainly at risk. In a case with similar circumstances, an infamous political consultant will stand trial on Michigan assault charges against a former state Representative.

Law enforcement officials took Sam Riddle into custody after he allegedly pointed a shotgun at his former lover, former state Representative Mary Waters. After she supposedly caught him in her bed with another woman right before Christmas, Water proceeded to call police. Riddle was then taken into custody on <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan assault charges </a>for his alleged actions.
<h2>Conflicting Testimonies Raise Questions</h2>
Last Friday, Riddle rejected a plea bargain and will take his trial to court, as the police report and witness statements contradict one another. Waters testified previously in court that she was never fearful of Riddle, even when he pointed the shotgun at her. However, the other woman, Takeisha Washington, stated that she never saw any firearms in the first place. "I never saw Sam with a gun or threaten Mary," Washington explained. Additionally, the only police report made was by one of the numerous officers that responded to the 911 phone call from Waters' stating that Riddle and Washington were in her bed having sex. However, a later statement from Waters maintained that this was not entirely true--they were in bed, but clothed and cuddling. Furthermore, she has also said since the original emergency phone call that she doesn't want Riddle prosecuted.

Nonetheless, the two will still go to trial together as co-defendants in a June 1st federal bribery scandal. Although they are only allowed to have contact with one another under lawyers supervision, they will face one another again in Wayne County Circuit Court for the accused assault charges on May 3rd.
