<h2><b>Former Aramark Supervisor Facing Felony Charges</b></h2>
Aramark, the company that provides food in Michigan prisons, has had some very bad press of late. Between the repeated negative reviews made public over the last three years, and the alleged drug-smuggling employees, they have become a name associated with controversy. Add to that the number of employees accused of having sexual relations with inmates, and the fines over food shortages, and you have a public relations disaster. So this new development, while not currently tied to Aramark, is unlikely to help with their issue of public image.

Michael R. Young, a 27-year-old former Aramark supervisor, is accused of attempting to bribe another inmate to commit assault on his behalf. According to police sources, he offered tobacco products to one inmate in return for finding another inmate who would be willing to assault another, specific, prisoner.<!--more-->

The inmate who Young first approached came forward and spoke to prison officials about what Young had proposed to him. According to the testimony, Young's uncle was murdered a few years ago, and he was hoping to exact revenge on the prisoner who was doing time for the murder. He allegedly provided specific details about his intended victim, including his name and prisoner number.

The supposed intended victim is actually serving time at another correctional facility. According to the witness who came forward, he was supposed to solicit an inmate at the other facility in order to have the assault carried out on the intended victim.

It was initially assumed by police during the early stages of the investigation, that the plan had been murder. But as it turns out, death had never been on the menu to begin with. Instead, Young had apparently intended all along for the result to be assault.

Young was fired from Aramark as soon as the allegations were made public last year in September. Following an extensive investigation by the MSP and the Attorney General's Criminal Division, Young was charged with a single count of Solicitation to Commit Assault with Intent to Cause Great Bodily Harm. In Michigan this is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

Young was arrested on March 19th and arraigned in the Chippewa County's 91st District Court.

He was granted a $10,000 conditional bond, which allowed him release as long as he was willing to wear an electronic tether. He has maintained his innocence throughout the investigation. Â All defendants should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, however, as <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank">criminal defense attorneys</a> we know that is sadly not always the case.
