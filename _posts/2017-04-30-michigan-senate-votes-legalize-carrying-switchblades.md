&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Switchblades, also sometimes called automatic knives, pushbutton knives, ejector knives, flick knives, or flick blades, have been illegal in Michigan and the rest of the USA for years. As defined by the federal government, </span><b>a switchblade is "any knife having a blade which opens automatically</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — (1) by hand pressure applied to a button or other device in the handle of the knife, or (2) by operation of inertia, gravity, or both." However, despite the fact that they sound handy and easy to use, they have been outlawed for more than half a century.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason? With the </span><a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/html/USCODE-2011-title15-chap29.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switchblade Knife Act of 1958</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the federal government outlawed the production, transportation, and possession of switchblades. Interestingly, Michigan didn't have to follow in federal footsteps on this one, as </span><b>it's been illegal to own a switchblade in the state of Michigan since 1931</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, Senator Rick Jones, a former Michigan Sheriff from Eaton County, believes that the law is being unevenly enforced across the state. In addition, he doesn't think it's a law that even makes sense any more.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"For years we’ve had on the books it’s a violation to have a knife with a mechanical way of opening it. And this has led to </span><b>a lot of people being charged with a 1-year, high misdemeanor and it really isn’t necessary</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." Senator Jones said after the vote. "They’re currently being sold all over Michigan, and I think it would be a terrible mistake to give a young person a year in prison for buying something they think is legal."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people speculate that the original outlawing of switchblades came as a reaction to Hollywood's attempts to glamorize the 'bad boy' character in the early days of film. Movies like </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebel Without a Cause</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050302/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Delinquents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and finally </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055614/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westside Story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promoted the idea that </span><b>roving gangs of dangerous criminal youth were threatening society</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and had to be stopped. Movies depicted them as armed with switchblades and itching for a fight, which made outlawing "gang blades" an obvious next step.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>A lot has changed in half a century...</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While this concern may have sounded valid in the 1950s, weaponry has changed significantly since then. As Senator Jones points out, "If a guy were in a gang fight today and pulled out a knife, he’d probably get shot.” </span><b>Switchblades are no longer the weapon of choice for gang fights and street crimes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although FBI stats show that knives are still considered to be very </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deadly weapons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in some cases are considered more dangerous than </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 245 aims to amend Michigan's original switchblade law. Specifically, the portion that outlaws knives that open with mechanical assistance, like switchblades. </span><b>In a 36 to 1 vote, the bill passed the upper chamber and moved on to the Senate Judiciary Committee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where it was approved by 5-0. Next stop is the Senate floor, where the bill would have to receive approval from the full Senate, followed by the full House, before finally landing on the Governor's desk for a signature.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Weapons charges in Michigan are treated as very serious crimes. There are so many people in prison right now for possession and sale of weapons that they never had any intention of using for criminal activity. </span><b>Being caught with an illegal weapon can result in extremely harsh penalties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people who are convicted. That’s why it's so important to have a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">skilled criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who understands Michigan's weapons law.</span>
