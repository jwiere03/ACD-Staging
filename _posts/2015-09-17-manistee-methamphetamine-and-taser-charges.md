In 2012, Michigan joined the 44 other states around the U.S. who had already legalized Tasers for civilian use. But like gun ownership, there are requirements that must be met before a person can walk around with a 50,000 volt weapon in their pocket. Which a Manistee man recently discovered when he was arrested in Frankfort, MI.

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Court documents show that 22-year-old Tyler James Vincent was arrested by detectives from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sheriffs Chiefs Enforcement Narcotics Team and Troopers with the MSP Seventh District Fugitive Team. The teams were after Vincent for drug possession, and the Taser possession was simply another chance for authorities to press charges.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days after his arrest on September 2nd, Vincent was arraigned on two felony charges. A single count of Possession of methamphetamine, which under Michigan law is a ten year felony, and a single count of Possession of a Taser, which could earn you up to four years in prison. He was arraigned in the Manistee </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">85th District Court.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law treats Tasers in a similar way to guns. In order to carry one, you will need to apply for a concealed carry permit. This does not apply to law enforcement, military personnel and corrections officers, but all other civilians would be required by law to have a permit.</span>


<h2>Like guns a number of places carrying a Taser not allowed</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like guns, there are also a number of places where carrying a Taser, even if you have a permit, is not allowed. Places like schools, hospitals, bars and sports stadiums are examples, although there are several more on the list.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who do have permits for their Tasers, they will still need to be careful how they use them. It is illegal to use your Taser against another human being except in self defense. Violation of this law will result in misdemeanor charges that could earn you up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But as in the case of Vincent, the penalties for unauthorized possession or sale are much more serious. Michigan law prohibits any person without a permit to possess a Taser for any reason, and sale of Tasers by anyone other than licensed dealers is also forbidden. Violation of this law is a felony that could net you up to four years in a state prison and a fine of up to $2,000.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vincent is currently being detained in the Manistee County Jail. His bond was set at $20,000, and as of yet, there is no indicator that he has posted it and is free. There is also no information regarding his next court date.</span>
