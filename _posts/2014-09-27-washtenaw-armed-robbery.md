<h2>Pizza Delivery Driver Robber Arraigned</h2>
Following a recent arraignment, 16-year-old Royce Xavier Ryan is now facing a felony count of armed robbery, for which he will be charged as an adult.

Ryan's charges come as a result of his alleged participation in a recent armed robbery that took place at the Motel 6 on South State Street in Pittsfield Township. This was just one of a string of robberies that occurred that night, during which pizza delivery drivers were robbed at gunpoint during the course of their evening deliveries.<!--more-->

Ryan is the last of the three youths to face arraignment for this particular slew of crimes, the other two being two 18-year-olds: Corey Michael Duncan of Ypsilanti Township, and Kyle Anthony Cryer of Ann Arbor.  Both were arraigned on charges of armed robbery.

According to police, the first Washtenaw armed robbery took place on September 11th, inside an apartment complex.  A pizza delivery driver told officials that someone had attempted to rob him at gunpoint, but he ran away when he saw the armed man approaching him, and nothing had had been taken.

The second robbery, however, was successful. A few short hours later at a Motel 6 not too far away, a another delivery driver was robbed by an armed man. According to reports made to police by the driver, the gunman took cash, along with a pizza and the delivery bag it was transported in.

Throughout that night, a series of armed robberies were carried out in Ypsilanti Township, all of the victims being pizza delivery drivers. All of the robberies were carried out for cash. No one was hurt.

The three teens are being held on $250,000 cash or surety bonds. Duncan and Cryer are being held in the Washtenaw County Jail, while Ryan is at the juvenile facility.

No scheduling dates for preliminary hearings have been made available yet.
