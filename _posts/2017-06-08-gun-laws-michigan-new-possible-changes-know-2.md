But how? Read on to find out…[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun laws are a highly charged topic of debate for many people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Michigan, where every year hundreds of thousands of people hunt and shoot, </span><b>gun rights and gun ownership are hotly contested subjects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the end, what it always comes back to is a U.S. citizen's Second Amendment right to bear arms, and whether or not that should be trumped by safety.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-laws-michigan-new-possible-changes-know-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous article in the series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we opened the discussion about </span><b>current Michigan gun laws that were being considered for change</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and new possible laws being introduced. We discussed the proposal to do away with concealed pistol license (CPL), the bill to ban civilians from carrying guns into police stations, and the proposed </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalizing of guns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aren't properly secured. Moving on, we're going to look at the next three bills being considered right now.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Expanding the number of places people may legally carry guns:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Michigan law is very specific about the places a lawful gun owner </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may not carry their weapon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - schools, sports arenas, hospitals, and university campuses, to name a few. However, House Bill 4565 aims to change that, by </span><b>increasing the number of places that legal gun owners may carry their weapons</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should this bill become law in Michigan, it would</span><b> do away with the prohibitions on many of these off-limits places</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including financial institutions (banks and credit unions), churches and other places of worship, theaters, sports arenas, day care centers and hospitals. This bill has received a great deal of negative press because of the guns-in-schools issue.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Expanding the number of places people with PPOs can carry guns:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 4268 would allow certain people with personal protection orders (PPOs) to carry their </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally obtained guns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a larger number of places. Specifically, </span><b>in places where it would otherwise not be allowed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This bill aims to increase the protections afforded to people who are in danger from specific individuals, and may need to defend themselves or their children.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Getting rid of local gun laws:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that is currently pending in the House Local Government Committee is the one that deals with </span><b>banning local gun laws in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this was signed into law, all local governments in Michigan who chose to pass gun control ordinances would have no more than 60 days to ensure that those laws were in accordance with state law. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that a local government (like a township, city or county) </span><b>passed a gun regulation that was contrary to state law and then enforced it on their residents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, those resident would be within their rights to bring a legal action in a circuit court, or to file a complaint with the Attorney General's Office. Local officials who knowingly enforced unlawful gun regulations could be fined up to $7,500 by the court. In other words, the proposed law would cause state law to preempt any locally passed gun laws or ordinances. </span>
