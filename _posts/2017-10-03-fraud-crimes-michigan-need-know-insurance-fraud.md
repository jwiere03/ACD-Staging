<h2><b>What is insurance fraud?</b></h2>
<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-insurance-fraud-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is when someone intentionally deceives an insurance company in order to collect money that they are not entitled to. This usually involves </span><b>fraudulent claims made under property, life, or automobile insurance policies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The type of fraudulent claims that fall into this category are varied, and range from slightly exaggerating existing claims, to deliberately causing accidents or damage in order to file a claim. It can also range from individual people committing fraud, to complex fraud rings involving many participants.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are examples of insurance fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because insurance fraud can take many forms, depending on the situation and the claim being made, there are many things that could count as insurance fraud. The following are some examples of insurance fraud sometimes committed in Detroit, Lansing, Livingston County and Grand Rapids:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staging a car collision in order to make a false insurance claims and collect insurance money</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a legitimate </span><a href="https://windrunkdriving.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">car crash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occurs, including other, prior damage to the vehicle in the insurance claim in order to receive a larger payout</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filing more than one claim for a single injury</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falsifying injuries in connection with car accidents. A common example of this is whiplash or soft tissue injury.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-arson-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burning down a building</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to receive the homeowner's insurance payment for the value of the home.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>How is insurance fraud discovered?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the type of fraud, there are many different ways that insurance fraud is detected. Most major insurance companies have fraud detection units. The investigators on staff </span><b>identify and investigate suspicious insurance claims</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because insurance companies in the US lose billions of dollars every year to insurance fraud, they are willing to spend millions protecting themselves against fraud.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is the penalty for insurance fraud in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Michigan, insurance fraud is a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> punishable by up to four years in prison, fines of up to $50,000.00, or both. The defendant may also have to pay restitution to the company they defrauded. Anyone </span><b>found guilty of conspiring to commit fraud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is facing up to 10 years behind bars, fines of up to $50,000.00, or both. In addition, Michigan courts routinely notify the state licensing board when someone is found guilty of fraud, which could mean the loss of your professional license.</span>
