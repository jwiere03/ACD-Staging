&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again for this discussion on facts about Michigan police that everyone should know. In the previous article we talked about the fact that </span><b>officers are very well trained, but that they make mistakes, and sometimes lie to defendants</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moving on, we are going to pick up where we left off and start right up with the next item on our list.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before we jump in we want to once again remind our readers that while this is an article about the police, we are not attacking all police officers or attempting to suggest that they are all corrupt. </span><b>Most police officers are good, hard working individuals who want the best for their communities and families</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  In most cases, officers are polite and respectful and we advise all of our readers to afford them the same courtesy. To be clear, we recommend being polite and respectful to the police even if you feel they are not being polite and respectful to you. Giving a cop a hard time is almost always a horrible idea.</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2><b>Resisting an arresting officer is a very bad idea….always.</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
You may not have committed a crime, or believe that you deserve to be <a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span>arrested</span></a><span>, but even if you are completely innocent, you should not fight the officer, flee from the police or resist arrest. The police have a hard job and they are constantly on high alert for anyone who may cause them physical harm. In addition, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span>they carry guns</span></a><span> and tasers, neither of which you want to be on the business end of if you can help it. So it is best to comply peacefully, and then call your lawyer ASAP! Additionally, you could face even more charges if you run or resist arrest! </span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2><b>You are not required to answer the police during an interrogation</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The law allows a person in police custody to remain silent, because almost anything they say will be used in court as part of evidence. This means every passing comment you make or joke you attempt to crack, every exchange you share with loved ones while in the presence of a police officer, and even your non-verbal reactions will be recorded and </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">used by police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bolster their case. We often find that statements to the police are misconstrued or reported incorrectly. Here’s our advice: Shut up!</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2><b>The police must read you your Miranda rights after you're in custody and before questioning you</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The part where an officer tells you that you have the right to remain silent? That's your </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miranda rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many officers carry a little card in their wallet that contains the Miranda rights so that if they are struggling to remember any part of it, they have a quick and convenient prompt available. This is important because any questions an officer asks you while you are in custody and before reading you your rights may not be admissible in court. It is important to note that officers are not required to read you your Miranda rights if you have not been placed in custody! OK, here’s the bottom line. Most people don’t understand what it means to be in custody. There’s a lot to it. Don’t try to figure out if you are in custody. Being in handcuffs does not automatically mean that you’re in custody. Just shut up! Keep quiet! Don’t talk! Even when the cop just wants to give you a chance to tell your side of the story, still shut up!</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2><b>You have the right to an attorney</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been arrested by police, if you are being questioned, or if you are being accused of a crime, you have the right to an attorney. The police are not allowed to deny you the ability to contact an attorney, nor are they allowed to continue to question you after you have stated your desire to consult with an attorney before questioning. As long as you clearly state to them that you want an attorney present and that you don’t want to speak to them without an attorney, they are required to wait a reasonable time to question you until an attorney arrives. </span>
