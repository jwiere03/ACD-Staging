<h2>Three Arraigned for Connection in String Of Robberies</h2>
Three men held in connection to a large string of robberies were recently arraigned in a District 41-A courtroom. Prosecutors accuse Eric Eby, 19, Logan Gerring, 17, and Jesse Brusseau-Meray, 20 of robbing a gas station and suspect their involvement in the robberies of three Macomb county churches. Each of the three men had slightly different charges given to them at their arraignment. Eby was charged with felony firearm, breaking and entering and possession of burglary tools. Gerring was also charged with breaking and entering and possessing burglary tools, as well as a weapons charge for having a taser. And Brusseau-Meray, whom reports indicate may or may not have been involved in the church robberies at all, received just breaking and entering and possessing burglary tools charges.

Police say that the churches were robbed around Easter weekend and that the gas station was held up recently. In one robbery for which the men are accused, at St. Therese of Lisieux Catholic Church, in Shelby Township, the men stole as much as $50,000, along with some items. Police say the men broke into the safe of St. Luke Lutheran Church in Clinton Township, though reports did not say how much money was taken. The third church mentioned in reports was St. Lawrence Catholic Church in Utica. No details of that robbery have been reported.

Police made the first of the arrests while responding to the events at the gas station, a Speedway in Shelby Township. Eby was captured at the scene, and Brusseau-Meray was arrested later on following a pursuit that involved a K-9 team. Gerring reportedly turned himself in. Police say that following the arrests they searched a storage locker used by one of the suspects and recovered some of the stolen property.

Police have indicated that they believe the men may have connections to other area robberies. Eby, Gerring, and Brusseau-Meray had bail set at $150,000, $75,000, and $10,000 respectively.
