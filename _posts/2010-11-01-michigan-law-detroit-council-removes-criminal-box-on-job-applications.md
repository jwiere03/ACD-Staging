Being convicted of any criminal charge is a life-changing experience for anyone to go through. Regardless of the crime committed, punishment can include fines, probation, and jail time. However, any criminal lawyer in Michigan can attest to the fact that the consequences of a conviction do not end with the sentence. Even after completing one's sentence and terminating probation, a convicted person can be forced to disclose their criminal history to others, particularly when applying for a job.

In cities across the state of Michigan, many rehabilitated felons are left disheartened and unemployed after being required to explain their run-ins with the law on their job application. Criminal check boxes are standard throughout the nation, asking applicants to note any misdemeanor or <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank">felony charge</a> of which they have been previously convicted. Often times, this will prevent an individual from receiving employment, ultimately making their reintegration in society much harder. It is standard practice today for employers to run criminal background check on their employees from time to time. When a conviction is noted on a LEIN (Law Enforcement Information Network) or CCH (Computerized Criminal History) reports, employees who did not report the conviction at the time of hire are often fired for their failure to disclose.


<h2>Finding a job is difficult for returning convicts</h2>

On average, 10,000 felony convicts return to the Detroit area after completing their assigned jail sentences each year. For these people, finding a job has proven increasingly difficult--immediately disclosing their criminal history almost automatically disqualifies them. While there is no law in the city of Detroit that bans felons from gaining employment, this information certainly influences the decisions made by interviewers.

In response to this problem, some municipalities have removed questions regarding criminal history off city job applications. On September 28th, the Detroit City Council joined them, after unanimously voting to lift barriers preventing ex-cons from gaining employment after rehabilitation. Instead, questions regarding one's criminal past will be moved to later in the interview process. This ultimately allows an employer to figure out if the person is qualified for the position, instead of immediately concentrating directly on their previous legal troubles.

Supporters of the "Ban the Box" coalition state that the change will help equalize the playing field for those returning from incarceration on felony crimes. Additionally, the measure will likely assist the thousands of Michigan residents coming to Detroit who have been convicted of felonies, but never served time behind bars. "By removing the question from many job applications in Detroit, it will really give people an opportunity to get their foot in the door, to have a job interview," explained Councilman Kenneth Cockrel Jr. "We don't want people to pay forever for a crime they committed in some decades ago."

One does not have to be a convicted felon to know that any criminal charge can haunt a person forever. After completing the rehabilitation process, an ex-con faces the daunting task of reintegrating themselves in society. In addition to the social stigmas that one will undoubtedly face, many roadblocks can prevent a person from establishing themselves as a law-abiding and productive citizen. Fortunately, concerned citizens, activists, and city officials are taking steps to assist convicted felons gain employment, truly completing the rehabilitation process.

To avoid the life-changing consequences associated with criminal charges, it is important to seek experienced and knowledgeable <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">criminal attorneys in Michigan</a> for assistance.
