&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">'Super' is one of those words that can have multiple meanings, depending on the context. </span><b>When something is super, it's awesome and wonderful</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Superman has incredible strength and 'superpowers' which could be defined as powers that defy understanding. If, however, something is super bad, that would make it really terrible. So what does that mean for the definition of 'super drunk'?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You guessed it - very drunk. Or extra drunk. Or waaaaaay more drunk than the regular variety of drunk. (Is there even a regular variety of drunk?) When Michigan passed the 'super drunk' law many people spoke out about how </span><b>they felt that the title 'super drunk' failed to convey the severity of the problem</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and could lead to confusion. We have certainly had to clarify some points in recent years for some of our clients. So we thought we'd provide you with a super basic breakdown. (Did you see what we did there?)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What does 'super drunk' mean in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, a driver whose blood-alcohol content (BAC) is 0.08 or above can be arrested and charged for drunk driving. However, once a driver’s BAC reaches 0.17, which is just more than twice the legal limit, they are considered to be 'super drunk.' </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are the penalties for being super drunk?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The penalties for super drunk driving in Michigan can depend on a number of factors.For example, if you've been charged for being super drunk and this is your first offense, or you've had no other drunk driving convictions in the last seven years, you could expect any of the following penalties:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fine of up to $700</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible jail time of up to 180 days</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 360 hours of community service</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible license suspension or restriction for up to 1 year</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 points added to your license</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mandatory completion of an alcohol treatment program</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of an ignition interlock device</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45 days driver’s license suspension</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for those people with prior drunk driving records from the last seven years who are convicted of being super drunk, the penalties may be even harsher. Even standard DUI punishments get extremely severe as the occurrences increase. Super drunk driving is no different.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How do I defend myself against super drunk charges?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer: you don't! In the same way that you don't do your own surgery, fly your own plane or rewire your own house (unless you happen to be highly trained in those areas) you shouldn't defend yourself in court. Super drunk driving, while it may have a somewhat silly sounding name, is </span><b>an extremely serious charge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
