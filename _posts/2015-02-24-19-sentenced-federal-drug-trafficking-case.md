After a two year investigation, a 72 count indictment, and a year of court dates, a federal drug trafficking case has finally been closed. Spanning both Michigan and Ohio, nineteen people have been sentenced. They will each be serving a significant amount of time behind bars.<!--more-->

According to investigators, a number of the individuals involved in Ohio purchased drugs from others in Michigan and Indiana. They then rented homes in Marion, Ohio in order to set up "one-stop-shops" from which to sell heroin, cocaine, and a number of prescription drugs like Percocet and Vicodin.

These homes were used as locations to store and sell the drugs. A number of vehicles were also involved in the dealings, all of which were registered to one person. It was an effort to reduce the suspicion of law enforcement, which obviously failed in the end.

According to police records, officials investigating the drug trafficking seized about 18 grams of heroin, 150 grams of crack cocaine, over 5,700 prescription pills, along with thousands of dollars in cash and eight guns during the course of the investigation


<h2>Nine of the sentenced were Michigan residents</h2>

Of the nineteen individuals federally indicted, nine of them were Michigan residents. This included five people from Detroit - Edward Hearn, 41, who was sentenced to 37 months in prison; Christopher Prince, 21, sentenced to 37 months in prison; Jason Graves, 23, who received a sentence of 33 months in prison; DeVonta Adams, 22, sentenced to 18 months in prison; and Darryl McFadden, 54, who will be spending 6.5 months in prison followed by 3 months of home confinement.

The remaining four Michigan individuals were from other parts of Wayne County and neighboring MaComb County. They are Terrance Lombard, 40, from Eastpoint who was sentenced to 41 months in prison; Marcus Benson, 35, from Harper Woods, sentenced to 36 months in prison; Marniece Love, 23, from Hazel Park, who was sentenced to 33 months in prison; and finally DeCarlos Bates, 21, from Hamtramck, sentenced to spend 30 months in prison.
