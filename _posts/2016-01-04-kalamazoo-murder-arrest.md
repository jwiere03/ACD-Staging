<h2><b>Returning to the Scene of the Crime Results in Murder Arrest</b></h2>
The idea that criminals return to the scene of the crime is not a new one, and can be found in countless movies and tv dramas nowadays. But is it actually true? Do those who commit crimes return later to the place where it happened? And why? Some say to gloat, others say it's pure curiosity. But in the case of Nasi Moshe Ben-Yaisrael, an 18-year-old resident of Kalamazoo, we have no idea. Yet.<!--more-->According to police records, a shooting took place at the Red Roof Inn just days ago resulting in one man dead of a gunshot wound. But by the time officers arrived, people were dispersing from the scene of the crime. Emergency responders were unable to resuscitate the victim, 18-year-old Deshontae Dewayne Ellis, a senior at Kalamazoo Central High School.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From fragments of evidence and testimony, officers were able to determine that there had been a party at the hotel, and a fight had broken out. Ellis may have been there at the time and then left, no one is sure. But either way, it is known that later in the evening he was the driver of a vehicle that pulled up outside the hotel, at which time the argument resumed in the parking lot. During the argument, Ellis was shot while still in the vehicle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers apparently singled Ben-Yaisrael out early in the investigation, as a suspect in the shooting. So the next day at about noon, when he showed up at the Red Roof Inn where detectives were still on the scene processing evidence, he was immediately noticed. He was a passenger in a vehicle that pulled into the parking lot, but after seeing police still present, tried to flee.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers were able to stop the vehicle and take Ben-Yaisrael into custody before he was able to flee the scene. Currently, the investigation is ongoing and there is no information regarding the charges that Ben-Yaisrael will likely be facing. However, it can be assumed that, since Ellis did not survive the shooting, he will be charged with murder.</span>
