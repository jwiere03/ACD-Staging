  A new system is being adopted in July

  parolees to check-in to parole and
  probation officers through phone, as

  designed to allow police officers more

  and help ease the social stigma
  surrounding probation for ex-inmates
  convicted of non-violent crimes.

After being convicted of criminal charges, punishments undoubtedly follow including fines or even jail time. If incarcerated, a person is almost certainly required to report in to a probation officer for a duration of time following release. While experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers recommend that those on probation always attend these meetings, many parolees neglect to travel to the appropriate precinct to check-in. However, a new program expected to start in July, would allow low-risk Michigan parolees to call in to an automated phone system, as opposed to actually going to see a parole or probation officer in person.

The new system, named OffenderLink, would require parolees or persons on probation to call in and leave answers to questions on a message machine. Their responses will later be reviewed by parole officers. OffenderLink can also help remind ex-cons of upcoming court dates or appointments that they are required to attend. The goal is to allow law enforcement officials more time to focus on high-risk parolees, particularly budget cuts mean that prisons close and release non-violent inmates. According to John Cordell, a spokesperson for the State Department of Corrections, "It will allow agents to spend more time on moderate and higher-risk offenders." He maintains that this will be helpful, especially considering that lower-risk convicts require less supervision anyways. These individuals are also likely to refrain from committing new crimes without any supervision or intervention from officers.

<h2>New technologies make it possible to monitor parolees</h2>

After the OffenderLink system showed great success in other states, Michigan has decided to give it a try as well. Of the 13,541 inmates granted parole in 2009, approximately 92 percent are considered low-risk for reoccurring criminal behavior. This would allow these individuals more freedom to reintegrate into society without having to report in person. While critics believe that this system would pose a public safety threat by eliminating accountability by the correction agents, new technologies make it possible to monitor parolees without physically seeing them. Global positioning devices allow law enforcement officials to track up to 30 released inmates at one time. Should one choose to leave the state or violate any other provisions of probation, police will know immediately and be able to handle the situation.

In order to make the program successful, parole officers stress the importance of working with low-risk releases and their families directly. Doing so will assist the ex-convict reintegrate into society easily and comply to supervision, without being required to physically check-in.

As aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">Michigan criminal defense attorneys</a>, we applaud the new OffenderLink system, as it allows parolees the ability to reintegrate into society easily and comply with supervision, without the social stigma surrounding monthly probation check-ins. However, in order to make the program successful, counsel and parole officers must work with the ex-convicts and their families directly. The correctional system is required to make sure that those convicted of crimes prepared to reenter society as painlessly as possible, including adopt any method that will obtain this goal more effectively--after all, the point of incarceration is rehabilitation, isn't it?
