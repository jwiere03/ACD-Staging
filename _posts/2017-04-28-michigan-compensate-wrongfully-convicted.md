&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When talking about Michigan criminal justice reform, which we do from time to time on this blog, one of the subjects that comes up regularly is </span><b>compensation of the wrongfully convicted</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you haven't run into the subject before, it refers to the government providing financial compensation for people who have been wrongfully </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convicted of crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and locked up for crimes that they didn't commit.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Michigan's criminal justice system has recently undergone some upgrades</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earlier this month Governor Snyder signed an </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/new-criminal-justice-reform-bills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18 bill package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law, that aimed to reduce recidivism and also addressed the state's parole and probation laws. Now however, another critical piece of the puzzle has finally been addressed - the issue of compensating those who have been wrongfully convicted by the Michigan criminal justice system.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 291, which was sponsored by State Senator Steve Bieda, makes </span><b>financial compensation available to those who were wrongfully convicted and locked up by the state of Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. House Bill 5815, sponsored by state Representative Stephanie Chang, provides re-entry services for the wrongfully convicted once they are released from prison. The bills, now called Public Acts 343 and 344 of 2016, took effect on March 29 of this year.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Nothing we offered would fully compensate for the true price paid by those who are wrongfully convicted.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement made by Governor Snyder on the day he signed the bills into law, he noted that, "Michigan’s </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal justice system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does a tremendous job, however there is always more we can do to make it better, particularly for those who have been wrongfully imprisoned for a crime they didn’t commit. While </span><b>we will never be able to fully repay those who have been wrongfully imprisoned</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this legislation helps support these individuals as they transition back into civilian life.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the “Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Act”, the state of Michigan will provide a wrongfully convicted person with </span><b>$50,000 for each year of wrongful incarceration they suffered</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, they will also receive financial compensation for attorney's fees they incurred defending themselves. The Department of Corrections will also now be responsible for providing basic reentry services for people who've been released from prison after a wrongful </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conviction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In creating Public Acts 343 and 344, Michigan joins with 31 other states and the federal government in providing the wrongfully convicted with partial compensation for their loss. As the Governor pointed out, no amount of money will ever give back the stolen years that they've lost, nor erase the pain and suffering they endured. </span><b>As experienced criminal defense attorneys in Michigan, we understand how heartbreaking it is to be falsely accused of a crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - we have defended many innocent people over the years. However, this is a step in the right direction towards providing redress.</span>
