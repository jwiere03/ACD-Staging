<h2><b>14-year-old Attempted Murder On His Mother</b></h2>
Teenagers arguing with their parents is common. In fact, it happens so often that most parents expect to have some real doozies with their kids during those often-awkward teen years. But it is rare to encounter a teenager who chooses to resolve the argument with a gun and attempted murder. 14-year-old Tommie Lee Grady, though, does not appear to be your average teenager.<!--more-->

According to police, Grady used a gun to shoot his mother several times at his family's home in Detroit. He also apparently turned the weapon on his brother afterwards. But instead of shooting him, Grady simply fled the scene.

Police searched the area for 14 hours before finally finding and arresting Grady, courtesy of an anonymous tip from a resident in the area. According to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, he has been charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-intent-commit-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank">assault with intent to commit murder</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felonious assault</a>, and minor in possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.

Grady has been "adult designated," which means that he'll be tried in the Wayne County juvenile court just like any other juvenile, but if convicted, the presiding judge is not required to sentence him like a juvenile. They may instead choose to sentence him as an adult. Essentially, the judge must decide whether to sentence Grady to a juvenile punishment, an adult punishment, or a mixture of the two.

Grady's mother was treated at Sinai-Grace Hospital before being released. Medical staff said she suffered multiple gun shot wounds, although thankfully none of them were fatal. No reason has yet been provided for why Grady chose to shoot his mother, or what it was that they were arguing about.

The most serious crime that Grady is charged with is assault with intent to commit murder, which under Michigan law, is punishable by up to life in prison. Should the judge elect to sentence Grady as an adult, he may end up facing the rest of his natural life behind bars. Thatâ€™s a very long time when you are only 14 years of age.
