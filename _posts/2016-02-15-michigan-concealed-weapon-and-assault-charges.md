<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trey Musselman, the 21-year-old man arrested the day after Christmas by the Michigan State Police, is now facing additional charges. He was originally charged for weapons-related crimes, but will now also be facing assault charges.</span><!--more-->

According to court records, the original charges against Musselman stem from an incident that took place on December 26, 2015. He was behind the wheel of a white 2003 Cadillac CTS, which he allegedly used to chase down Michael Pfeifer and Kristopher Hogan.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pfeifer told police that he and Hogan were walking down the street together, when the Cadillac drove by. But the vehicle turned and sped up, rushing towards them and causing them to flee. The car then jumped the curb and chased Pfeifer around a parking lot and down a one way alley in the wrong direction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At that point the vehicle was stopped and, according to Pfeifer's testimony, Musselman got out of the driver's seat carrying a baseball bat. "You are going to learn a lesson!" is what he allegedly said to Pfeifer, who fled the area immediately. Musselman then got back into the car and drove away.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After Bronson Police requested that law enforcement be on the lookout for a vehicle matching the Cadillacâ€™s description, an MSP trooper found the car on US-12. Inside, sitting behind the wheel, was Musselman, who had a pair of gloves in his lap and a bandana mask around his neck. He was dressed all in black.</span>


<h2>No explanation for the double edged knife and other weapons</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The officer found the baseball bat described in the threats, but Musselman told the officer that he had the bat because he played baseball. He didn't, however, have an explanation for the double edged knife, brass knuckles and loaded shotgun that were also found inside the car.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Musselman was initially charged with two counts of possession of a dangerous weapon and a single count of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html" target="_blank">carrying a concealed weapon</a>. Under Michigan law, possession of a dangerous weapon is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, while carrying a concealed weapon without a permit is a two year felony. The new charges, which pertain to <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">felonious assault</a>, have been authorized by the prosecutor's office.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Musselman was granted a $25,000 bond and is currently free. His arraignment on the newest charges has been scheduled for this week.</span>
