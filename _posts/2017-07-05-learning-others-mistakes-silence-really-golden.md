&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every now and again someone does something that serves as a perfect example for everyone around them of what NOT to do! Case in point: </span><b>Martin "Pharma Bro" Shkreli</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the controversial former pharmaceutical CEO, who achieved notoriety for raising the cost of Daraprim, a life-saving drug, from US$13.5 to US$750 per pill.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, Shkreli was indicted and arrested by the FBI, who </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-insurance-fraud-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged him with securities fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These federal charges were filed after his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin were both investigated. It was determined that </span><b>Shkreli was running a Ponzi-like scheme</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to a press release from the United States Department of Justice, "As alleged, Martin Shkreli engaged in multiple schemes to ensnare investors through a web of lies and deceit." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the reason we bring up Shkreli is because he has made waves recently as a result of going against his attorney's advice, and </span><b>discussing his case online and with the media</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since posting bail, the controversial former CEO has made numerous comments on social media and other online forums which may serve to complicate his defense in the federal criminal court.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Twitter, Shkreli called members of Congress "imbeciles" because they required that he tell them the reason why his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of Daraprim. In another instance he </span><b>used twitter to target journalist Lauren Duca</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, harassing her with fake pictures of herself and Shkreli cuddling, and name calling. As a result his Twitter account was suspended, and he was later permanently banned from the app. On Facebook he has made comments about</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/immunity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being unjustly imprisoned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At his pretrial hearing, when Shkreli's criminal defense attorney was asked about his client's 'loose cannon' approach to discussing his case. Benjamin Brafman described him as someone who "travels to the beat of a very unique drummer." Those who were present for the pretrial in federal court said that </span><b>Brafman sounded very exasperated and frustrated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with his client's decision to disregard advice to keep silent.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As defense attorneys, we completely understand Brafman's frustration. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussing a case, even with close friends and loved ones, can have disastrous results! </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to police without your attorney present</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, explaining aspects of your case on social media, or even just trying to set the record straight with loved ones can have unintended consequences for you. This in turn can </span><b>make your defense harder for your attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of how this could play out is exactly what's happening at Shkreli's trial right now. The court is having a very hard time selecting a jury, due to all of the negative press that has surrounded Shkreli thus far. One juror told the judge that the defendant was </span><b>"the face of corporate greed," while another called him "the most hated man in America."</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One potential juror made hand motions implying that he would like to wring Shkreli's neck, while another one told the federal judge that, upon seeing Shkreli, she instantly thought of him as a snake.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenges faced by Shkreli's defense attorney is very real, and one that we can relate to. Nothing is more frustrating that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working hard to protect a client's rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and construct a complex defense strategy, only to have all of your hard work undone by one Facebook comment, or one discussion with a family member. </span><b>Loose lips do indeed sink ships!</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been accused of a crime in Michigan, be certain to keep your lips sealed! Don't talk to the police, or to your cellmate in jail. Don't talk to your friends or family members, even if they're on your side and are supportive of you. </span><b>And don't, under any circumstances, discuss anything related to your case online!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Silence really is golden! So observe the golden rule, do yourself a huge favor, and don't breathe a word to anyone but </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Trust us, your silence can be the difference between freedom and prison time!</span>
