&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail fraud is one of the most common </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/financial-fraud-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">types of fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> committed in the United States, and here in Michigan we're no exception. </span><b>Hundreds of cases of suspected mail fraud are investigated every year in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lots of these investigations lead to criminal charges. However, if you aren't involved in mail fraud yourself, and you aren't a Postal Inspector or a member of the Michigan State Police Fraud Investigation Unit, you may not know what mail fraud looks like when it's in play. Don't worry - many people here in Michigan don't know. So we're going to break it down for you.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail fraud is a federal offense, and it's been a crime in this country since 1872. Committing mail fraud means </span><b>using a scheme to intentionally defraud another person of money or property, by mail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In other words, using the mail to trick someone, so that you profit from their confusion, fear or misunderstanding. But what does that look like when it's happening here in the Great Lakes state? What would a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-healthcare-claims.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan mail fraud scam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like? Most commonly, it would look like this:</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Financial Fraud:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any scheme intended to </span><b>defraud someone of their money, or other assets worth money</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can be classified as financial fraud. This may include Ponzi schemes and other types of financial investment fraud, disguising solicitations sent via U. S. mail as invoices, attempting to charge money for free government services, and "900" or "976" telephone number fraud.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Sweepstakes and Lottery Fraud:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a well-known scam, and it happens all over the country, including here in Michigan.To pull this one off, the scammer sends mailed notices to people (the elderly are often targets of this type of scam) informing them that </span><b>they've won a sweepstakes or lottery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, in order to "unlock" their prize, they have to send a small payment to cover "fees" or provide their personal information. In many cases, victims are </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-check-fraud-law.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent a fake check</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they can deposit into their bank account, which will bounce. But by then it's too late - the scammers have collected the fees and are gone.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Employment Fraud:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of mail fraud involves a scammer offering "</span><b>work at home" opportunities or fake jobs through the mail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This could include all kinds of "great money-making opportunities" like pyramid schemes, fake postal service jobs, fraudulent distributorships and franchises, postage scams and phony </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mystery shopper jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Fraud Against Elderly Americans:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Elderly Michigan residents are frequently targeted by scammers because </span><b>many of them lack knowledge about modern technology</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, many of them grew up in an era when using the mail to defraud people was often unheard of, and so they are more likely to assume that the paper they've received in the mail is official. Schemes that target the elderly include reverse mortgage scams, scams selling </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">counterfeit prescription drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a lower price, and offering Social Security refunds in exchange for bank account information.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Have you been accused of committing mail fraud in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that </span><b>there are always two sides to the story</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sometimes people really did want to offer others an opportunity to join them in a new job, and the prosecutor or United States Attorney simply can't see the potential in this new business venture. Sometimes people truely didn't know that what they were doing was against the law. Or perhaps they simply didn't realize the effects it would have under Michigan law and under Federal law. There is always more to the story.</span>
