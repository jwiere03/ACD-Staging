&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they're going to be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good at their jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, criminal defense attorneys have to be creative. They have to be strategists who can think outside the box. Why? Because they're fighting an uphill battle, and the system is often stacked against them. With that in mind, we thought we'd share </span><b>a few really interesting and unconventional defense strategies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from recent history that have actually worked.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Lorena Bobbit</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You've probably heard of this one (most people have!) Lorena Bobbitt was the woman who </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked her sleeping husband</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a kitchen knife, and cut off his penis. She then jumped into her car, drove out of town, and tossed the severed member into a field. Why? Because </span><b>she had endured years of abuse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at his hands. She did call 911 though, after realizing the enormity of what she had done.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Lorena's testimony, John Bobbit had </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotionally, sexually and physically abused her</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years. He flaunted his infidelities, stole her earnings and spent them, battered her, and threatened her. On the night that she butchered him, he had allegedly raped her. Because John's testimony had more holes in it that Swiss cheese, and he couldn't keep his story straight, </span><b>the prosecution's argument was seriously weakened</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the end, the jury found Lorena not guilty due to insanity causing an irresistible impulse to sexually wound John.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Identical Twins</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identical twins are widely known to pull pranks, switch places, and </span><b>pretend to be one other</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to confuse friends and family. But Sathis Raj and Sabarish Raj took their role-switching to another level. Or at least, one of them did…</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the brothers was charged with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trafficking 166 pounds of marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Malaysia. However, the court was never able to determine which one it was. Both brothers denied it and claimed it was their twin who was guilty. Police </span><b>weren't able to prove which one it was</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the DNA evidence simply proved that one of them had been present. As a result, they avoided hanging, which was the punishment.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Matrix Insanity</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When police questioned Tonda Lynn Ansley of Hamilton, Ohio, about the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shooting death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of her landlady, Ansley admitted she had done it. Her reason? The landlady had been </span><b>part of a scheme to brainwash and murder</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ansley herself. She also told police that "they commit a lot of crimes in the Matrix."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her defense attorney argued that Ansley couldn't be guilty because she was </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/defenses-to-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suffering from insanity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His explanation was that, "Our world is just an illusion generated by our machine overlords." The result? The jury found Ansley </span><b>not guilty by reason of mental defect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Awake or Asleep?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenneth Parks </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stabbed his mother-in-law to death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the night of May 23rd, 1987. There was never a question about who committed the crime, because as soon as it was over, Parks drove himself to the local police station and </span><b>turned himself in</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Upon his arrival, he announced to officers that he thought he may have killed someone. But he wasn't sure…</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How could he be unsure of such an extreme act? Because according to his attorney, </span><b>he was asleep when he did it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although his defense was met with extreme skepticism, an EEG (which is a brain wave test)  revealed that Parks suffered from abnormal brain activity. That was indicative of extreme parasomnia (which refers to all of the abnormal things that can happen to a person while they're sleeping.) This, combined with a total lack of motivation, resulted in an acquittal for Parks.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The importance of a good defense attorney</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although these types of defenses are extremely rare, and shouldn't be taken as examples of a usual defense, they're good examples of how important it is to have an experienced defense attorney that will pull out all the stops in crafting your defense strategy. Hard work, ferocity and dedication are important, but sometimes they just aren't enough! </span><b>You also need creativity, experience, and access to a wide range of experts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to strategize a really strong defense.</span>
