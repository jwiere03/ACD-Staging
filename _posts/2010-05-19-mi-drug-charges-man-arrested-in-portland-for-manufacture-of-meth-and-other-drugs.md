  Although the State of Michigan has laws
  allowing use of marijuana for medical
  purposes, the manufacture, possession,
  or distribution of other illicit
  narcotics is still prohibited. Such an
  example is seen in a recent case where
  Michigan police officers arrested a man

  suspecting he was running a drug house.

Although Michigan voters passed a bill allowing residents to use marijuana for medical purposes, other illicit drugs are still prohibited against law. Any dedicated Michigan criminal defense attorney can attest that the manufacture, possession, or distribution of hard drugs can land a person in serious trouble. Because these narcotics are still considered illegal, it is possible for a person caught to be accused with criminal charges resulting in life-changing consequences.
<h2>Portland Police Officers Arrest Man During a Search on Numerous Drug-Related Charges</h2>
After an extensive investigation conducted by the local police department and the Central Michigan Enforcement Team, a search warrant was executed in a Portland home suspected of being a drug house. Upon entering the home, law enforcement officials located items assisting in the manufacture of methamphetamine, as well as other narcotics.

Police arrested the suspect, Rory Pline, 35, who was home at the time of the search. He was immediately taken to Ionia County Jail, and was formally accused of numerous <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan drug charges</a> on May 11<sup>th</sup>. According to the Lansing State Journal, the long list of violations against Pline includes: possession of methamphetamine components, operating a meth lab near a school, possession of methamphetamine and marijuana, as well as maintaining a drug house.

At this time, the investigation is currently ongoing to discover any additional details that could affect the outcome of the case against Pline.

As seen by the example of Rory Pline, the consequences for being caught in possession of illicit drugs can be severe, as well as life-changing. Not only are legal repercussions brought against the suspect, but conviction of drug-related crimes instantly tarnishes a reputation forever.
