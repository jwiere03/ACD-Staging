&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The subject of cyberbullying has been on the rise in recent years, as has the problem of online bullying itself. As the world becomes more connected, and social media plays a more integral role in people's daily lives, </span><b>instances of bullying via the internet have grown in frequency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the discussion surrounding this subject has favored legislation that protects victims and prosecutes offenders, not every state has bought into the idea of making cyber bullying illegal.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://cyberbullying.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyberbullying Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, currently 34 of the 50 states have laws against online bullying. MIchigan, however, is one states of those where hounding and harassing someone online is still not a crime per se. Although maybe not for long. Republican Representative </span><a href="http://gophouse.org/representatives/southeast/lucido/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Lucido</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><b>sponsored a bill that he hopes will result in laws against cyberbullying in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A problem that he describes as a growing epidemic.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 16 states where cyberbullying is still not a crime are Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Though if Lucido gets his way that list will only be 15 states long. So, you may be asking yourself, if this is such a problem, </span><b>why aren't all the states jumping onboard?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, the answer isn't straightforward.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, one has to consider the fact that some legislators don't believe that cyber bullying needs it's own legislation. All states have </span><b>various criminal laws that might apply to bullying behaviors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on the nature of the act. For example, if someone is physically hurting another person, a</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ssault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statutes might apply. All 50 states have criminal </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/protection-orders.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harassment and/or stalking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statutes, most of which include explicit reference to electronic forms. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>So why does Michigan need a cyberbullying law anyway?</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that legislators may believe that a specific cyberbullying law is unnecessary, because the current laws can be used to prosecute someone who is believed to be guilty of cyberbullying. For example, </span><b>Michigan currently has statutes that make it illegal to assault, stalk or harass someone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also have laws making it illegal to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-of-a-computer-to-commit-a-crime-in-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use a computer to commit a crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that if you used your computer to harass a person, you could technically be charged with two different crimes. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, in 2015 Governor Snyder signed Senate Bill 74 (now Public Act 478) into law, which made it a requirement for </span><b>all Michigan schools to add cyberbullying to their anti-bullying policies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The legislation also required that the </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Department of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> create procedures for reporting this information to the state. So if we already have all of these laws in place, why do we need a cyberbullying statute?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Lucido, it's because "This is an issue that goes beyond age, race, gender, and everything else, because everybody is on the internet. We have crimes in Michigan that </span><b>if it’s done in person, it is prosecuted</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">...if I say I’m going to beat someone up to their face, that’s assault. If I do on the internet, nobody’s getting prosecuted. That’s ridiculous. It’s still a threat and that should be illegal, no matter if it’s face-to-face or viewed on a computer screen."</span>

The bill covers all forms of intimidation that is transferred electronically from one person to another.</span>
