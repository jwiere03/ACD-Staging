<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask anyone about the hippocratic oath, and most people will parrot back the phrase, "Do no harm." However, while</span><b> it may come as a surprise to you, this phrase doesn't actually appear anywhere in the Hippocratic oath</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, the oath itself is not actually required for a doctor to practice medicine. Some hospitals and private practices require that doctors swear this oath, while some use a modern version, and others require no oath at all.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Dr. Aria Sabit might not have sworn an oath to "do no harm" to his patients, the law is very specific about what he is and isn't allowed to do when it comes to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/health-care-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to federal court records here in Michigan, </span><b>Sabit is accused of performing multiple unnecessary spinal surgeries on patients</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leaving some of them permanently injured and disabled, as part of an extensive </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-healthcare-claims.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fraud scheme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dr. Sabit pled guilty to federal charges of fraud and conspiracy. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourteen of Dr. Sabit's former patients appeared before Federal Judge Paul Borman to share their stories. </span><b>Federal prosecutors referred to Sabit's surgical operation, many of which were left incomplete or incorrectly performed, as "butchery."</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They also claimed that Dr. Sabit collected kickbacks from implant manufacturers. Some of his former patients told the judge that since their surgeries performed by Aria Sabit, they are in constant pain and have difficulty with even the most mundane daily tasks.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the questionable surgeries and kickbacks, Dr. Sabit admitted to federal investigators that he had performed incomplete surgeries and then </span><b>dictated into his operative notes that he had performed "spinal fusion" surgeries with instrumentation, when in fact he had not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These notes, he admitted, would later be used to submit </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-insurance-fraud-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fraudulent insurance claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his own financial gain.</span>

&nbsp;

<h2>Fraudulent surgeries and falsifying insurance claims didn't only happen in Michigan!</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to law enforcement, Dr. Sabit worked in California at Community Memorial Hospital, where he later admitted </span><b>harming some of his patients, accepting kickbacks and committing insurance fraud.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Almost 30 of his patients sued him for malpractice as a result. He later surrendered his medical license in California and in 2011 he moved to Michigan. Once here, Dr. Sabit opened the </span><a href="http://michiganspineandbrainsurgeons.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Brain and and Spine Physicians Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has offices in Southfield, Dearborn and Clinton Township. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another issue that has been raised during the investigation into Dr. Sabit's healthcare fraud allegations is the fact that he allegedly obtained U.S. citizenship illegally in 2013. </span><b>This is a result of not disclosing the fraud allegations against him during his citizenship application process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All in all, Dr. Sabit's greedy fraud scheme netted him over $2.8 million. Dr. Sabit is now known as Inmate Sabit. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabit was </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bail-bonds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denied bail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after his arrest, as </span><b>the prosecutors argued that he was a flight risk</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He remained in detention until his sentencing by Judge Borman in the United States District Court, Eastern District, in Detroit. There, Judge Borman ordered that Sabit will spend 19 years in federal prison.</span>
