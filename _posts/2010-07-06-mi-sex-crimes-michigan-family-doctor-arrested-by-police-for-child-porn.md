The Internet is used by millions of people worldwide to share and exchange information. While it is certainly a beneficial invention that has influenced life as we know it, the world wide web can also get people into serious trouble. Experienced sex crime lawyers in Michigan can confirm: law enforcement officials are engaged in an ongoing investigation searching for illegal criminal activity online, including sex crimes. To prevent sexual offenses against minors, one main target of these investigations are child pornographers.
<h2>Consequences For Doctor In Possession Of Child Pornography</h2>
As seen by the recent case of a doctor held for sex crimes in Michigan, even receiving kiddie porn can have serious consequences. Law enforcement officials arrested Craig Tubbs, M.D., 45, after a criminal complaint filed last week stated he received numerous sexually explicit images involving children. U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) agents were alerted to Tubbs' e-mail and IP addresses during their search for child pornographers. After executing a search warrant on the family physician's e-mail account, police allegedly discovered images of children engaging in sexual conduct.

After arrest, the doctor of 24 years appeared in federal court on the Michigan sex crimes charges against him. Although the court released him on a $50,000 bond, he is restricted to the Eastern District of Michigan, compelled to surrender his passport, and ordered to have no unsupervised interaction with children under the age of 18. Should he be convicted of the child porn charges against him, Tubbs could face 20 years behind bars and be required to pay a fine up to $250,000.

As seen by the example of Craig Tubbs, online activity is monitored by law enforcement officials for numerous crimes, including sex offenses. Should investigators suspect anyone of criminal activity, they can obtain search warrants to look through your online accounts, including your e-mail. Evidence discovered online is incriminating and can be used against you in court. To protect yourself from the serious consequences that stem from a sex crime conviction, it is essential to be pro-active in securing the best defense for your case.
