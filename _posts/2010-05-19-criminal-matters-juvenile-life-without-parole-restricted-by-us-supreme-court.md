  Although a 2005 decision from the U.S.
  Supreme Court prohibits the state from
  sentencing any juvenile to the death
  penalty, the court further clarified the
  ruling this week. In a 5 to 4 decision,
  non-homicidal minors can no longer be
  incarcerated for life, and must be given
  a "meaningful" chance to obtain their
  freedom. The majority based their ruling
  on the basis that it was
  unconstitutional and violated the Eighth
  Amendment on cruel and unusual
  punishments.

Legal cases and criminal proceedings involving minors is always a delicate subject, particularly for experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers. Under the Eighth Amendment preventing cruel and unusual punishment, as well as a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision, persons under the age of 18 are prohibited from receiving the death penalty. Since that point, the ruling just applied to the execution of minors, not necessarily the sentences for other violent crimes. However, earlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court further expanded the scope of the decision, to prohibit life sentences behind bars for juveniles who have not committed homicide.


<h2>The state must allow minors a chance to rejoin society</h2>

In a closely split ruling, the Supreme Court stated that prohibiting non-murderous juveniles from ever rejoining society is not only unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, but it contradicts the efforts of both the national and "global" consensus. Writing for the majority was Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who explained that states must allow minors who receive extensive prison sentences a "meaningful" chance to rejoin society at large. "By denying the defendant the right to re-enter the community, the state makes an irrevocable judgment about that person's value and place in society. This judgment is not appropriate in light of a juvenile non-homicide offender's capacity for change and limited moral culpability," he wrote.

In the State of Michigan, while the vast majority of people serving time are adults, there are also a significant number of inmates who are minors. Currently, the state has approximately 350 individuals incarcerated on life sentences for crimes committed while they were younger than 17 years-old.

Although the exact effect the new ruling will have on these Michigan juvenile offenders, experts believe that the Supreme Court's ruling was an important change in the correctional system, and will undoubtedly cause a wave of litigation.
