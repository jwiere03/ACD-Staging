<h2><b>Husband Charged in Connection with Wife's Shotgun Injury</b></h2>
A recent  incident in Clare County ended with a 35-year-old woman shot in the leg, and her husband taken away in the back of a patrol car as a result. According to reports from the Clare County Sheriff's Department, the man is now facing charges in connection with the shooting incident. But what really happened?<!--more-->

Dispatch records show that the call came in on Sunday, December 27th, minutes after 9 pm. The caller claimed that someone in Garfield Township had discharged a firearm, and someone else was hurt. It wasn't intentional, according to the caller, but intent only counts for so much in the eyes of the law.  And firing a weapon inside a home is frowned on by law enforcement in Michigan.

Sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene to find a woman with a gunshot wound in her left leg. They administered first aid until the EMTs arrived and took over. But at that point, they turned their attentions to the victim's husband, 39-year-old Ray Richard Hansen.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers found and seized the gun that was used to shoot the victim accidentally. It was a short-barreled shotgun, also known as a sawed-off shotgun, which is actually illegal to own here in the mitten state.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hansen's arraignment took place on Monday, December 28th, in the 80th District Court which serves both Clare and Gladwin Counties.  He was charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank">Careless or reckless discharge of a firearm causing injury</a>, which is a high court misdemeanor under Michigan law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the penal code lists the sentences for this particular crime as being either up to two years in prison, a possible fine of up to $2,000, or a year in the county jail. It is specified in the law that the sentence is up to the discretion of the Judge.</span>

Hansen was granted a $7,500 bond, but there is no word as of yet regarding whether or not he has posted bail.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hansen's wife, the shooting victim, was flown to a hospital in Midland to receive emergency medical treatment, and then moved to Hurley Medical Center in Flint for continued treatment. She is currently listed as being in stable condition, according to medical staff there.</span>
