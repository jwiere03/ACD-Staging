<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again. In <a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/6-steps-choosing-right-michigan-criminal-defense-attorney-part-1.html">our previous article</a>, we talked about how to approach the issue of </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/about-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">needing a criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whether you're facing state or federal charges, and making sure you choose an attorney that practices criminal law are important points. Moving on we're going to look at a few more </span><b>things you need to take into account when selecting a Michigan criminal defense attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remember, the right attorney is critical. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are your priorities?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you're charged with a crime, </span><b>the most important thing is having the best possible outcome for your case</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That should always be your primary goal when hiring a criminal defense attorney. However, there are other things that are important as well.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a good working relationship with your criminal lawyer is vital. You're going to spend a lot of time dealing with them, so </span><b>it's critical that you're able to get along and trust them to do their job properly</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Feeling like your defense attorney doesn't have time for you, doesn't care about your opinions, and doesn't listen to you are NOT want you want! In short, you ought to feel comfortable with your lawyer and with his entire defense team. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, people look for certain qualities in the attorney they choose. Things like </span><b>being a good listener, a willingness to address client concerns, and patience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when explaining complex legal issues or answering questions about the case are all important. These can make your case run more smoothly and reduce time wasted on unnecessary things, like arguing. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Do some research before making your choice.</b></h2>
<b>Anyone can look good on their own website,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but is there any other information available to </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">back up their claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Read reviews left for the law firm and the attorney you're considering. What did others have to say? Which national, statewide and local media outlets have covered them? Have they ever been featured in the news? Was it for good work on a case, or for bad behavior?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another indicator of a good attorney is a good education. Find out where your attorney of choice went to get their law degree, and what degree they hold. </span><b>Having a Juris Doctorate (also called a Juris Doctor) from a reputable law school goes a long way</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is especially true if the attorney graduated cum laude (which means "with honors" in Latin). Bear in mind however, that education only goes so far - </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/about-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience counts for a WHOLE LOT more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Make use of the free consultation!</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most attorneys offer</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a free consultation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This lets you meet them before you decide to hire them. ALWAYS make use of the free consultation! Often, top Michigan criminal attorneys are willing to do the initial consultation by phone. That expedites the process and still allows both side to get to know one another. </span><b>It's a great way to to learn more about your case, and to figure out if you and your criminal defense attorney are a good match</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pay attention to their communication skills, as these will be crucial during this process. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, ask about their resources. Most top notch criminal lawyers in Michigan have a large staff consisting of law clerks, researchers, associate attorneys, paralegals, investigators and so on. Be sure that the law firm won’t be <strong>farming your case out to some outside, independent contract attorneys</strong> that does work for lots of law firms. The best lawyers work full time for one particular law firm, in the firm’s office, with a complete support staff. If you’re not speaking to a criminal attorney like that, then move on. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure that you choose the best possible criminal defense team to represent your interest in a criminal case can make a huge difference in how your case turns out. </span><b>A skilled attorney can mean the difference between a dismissal and 20 years behind bars.</b>
