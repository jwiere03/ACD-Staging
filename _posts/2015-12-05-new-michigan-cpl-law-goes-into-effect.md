<h2><b>Supporters Cheer New CPL Regulations</b></h2>
As of Tuesday, December 1st 2015, a new law has gone into effect regarding Concealed Pistol Licenses (CPL) in Michigan. So if you're a licensed gun owner, or are considering becoming one, then this article is for you.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have read some of our </span><a href="http://abuseandneglectdefense.com/new-gun-law-no-danger-for-domestic-abuse-victims.html/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addressing the fact that Governor Snyder chose to veto proposed gun bills in the interest of keeping domestic violence victims safe from their abusers. At the time the Governor expressed his interest in revisiting the subject after the bill had dealt with that particular issue in a way that ensured greater safety for victims of domestic violence.</span>

Which, as it turns out, that is exactly what happened. The gun bill was quickly revisited, and careful consideration given to who exactly is allowed to receive concealed carry permits. Specifically, blanket rules were put in place to prohibit an individual from getting a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/concealed-pistol-license-law-michigan.html" target="_blank">CPL</a> if there is a personal protection order out against them.

Senate Bills 34 and 35 were signed into law by Governor Snyder in early March, and as of the first day of December, they are now in effect. But what does that mean for gun owners across Michigan? Will anything be changing? And if so, what will those changes be?

Well, the truth is that there will be changes. But gun owners won't really notice them, as they will be more "behind-the-scenes" than anything else. Under the new law, county gun boards have been eliminated. The responsibility of running background checks and processing the applications of individuals applying for CPLs now falls to the Michigan State Police (MSP) and to county clerks.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who stood in favor of this bill say that it will streamline the process by removing a layer of protocol that an applicant will have to go through. Additionally, supporters say that this will make the application process more fair and unbiased. This is because it is believed that local officials could deny someone a permit on the grounds that they looked unworthy, undesirable, or like they may be a "trouble-maker."</span>

But for those who were opposed to the law, this was exactly why the bills were a bad idea. According to their argument, by eliminating the local authorities who may have information about the person applying that wouldnâ€™t necessarily show up on a standard background check, we are eliminating a valuable resource.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Opinions aside, the law is the law, and this is how CPL permit applications will be handled around the state for the foreseeable future. So let's hope the change is smooth, and that the process proceeds without issues.</span>
