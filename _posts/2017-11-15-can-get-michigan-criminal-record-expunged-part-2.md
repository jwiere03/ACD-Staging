<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again today. We're looking at </span><b>what an expungement means in Michigan, and what you need to know to pursue it for yourself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/can-get-michigan-criminal-record-expunged-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we discussed exactly how Michigan law defines expungement, which crimes would disqualify you from the process, and what the application process looked like. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>You will need to meet specific criteria for a Michigan expungement</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your prior crimes haven't disqualified you from applying for </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expungement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are still </span><b>certain criteria you'll need to meet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remember, this is a complex  process, and the court doesn't hand out expungements to just anyone. It requires a lot of work by your attorney. That effort is almost always always worth it when you consider your future! </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Here are some things you need to know about the process:</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have only one felony conviction on your criminal record, and no more than two misdemeanors, in order to petition the court to dismiss the felony conviction.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have up to two misdemeanor convictions and no </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felonies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can request that the court expunge one or both of your misdemeanor convictions.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were convicted of </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan-4th-fourth-degree-criminal-sexual-conduct-csc-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourth Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before January 14th, 2015, and you have not been convicted of another crime (other than two “minor offenses”) since then, you may ask the court to set aside the conviction.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted in the previous article, five years must have passed since your last day of jail, sentence, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or discharge from parole (whichever is later).</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who was convicted of </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/prostitution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prostitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may request that the court expunge their record if they were forced into the sex trade as a victim of human trafficking.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>What is a 'minor offense'?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's important to note that the term "minor offense" is very specific in its definition. Under Michigan law,</span><b> a 'minor offense' is a misdemeanor or ordinance violation punishable by no more than 90 days</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a maximum fine of no more than $1,000.00. In addition, the law says that in order for a crime to count as a minor offense, it must be committed by a person who is 21 years old or younger.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to juveniles applying for an expungement, there are different rules that the court follows. </span><b>A juvenile may have adjudications set aside by the court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they don't have more than three juvenile offenses on their record. Also, they can't have any felony convictions on their record. In case you're wondering what an adjudication is, it's just another way of saying "verdict" or "</span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" handed down by the court.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>What about juvenile adjudications? Are they different?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A juvenile adjudication is not the same thing as an adult conviction. In some cases, it doesn't even appear on the juvenile’s criminal record. There are, however, </span><b>certain situations where a juvenile adjudication will be entered into the public record</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is often when people choose to pursue getting that crime expunged from their criminal record. This is an issue that should be discussed between you and your attorney before petitioning the court. </span>
