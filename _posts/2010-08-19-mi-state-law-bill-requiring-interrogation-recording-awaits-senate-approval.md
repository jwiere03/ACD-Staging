Whenever anyone is arrested on criminal charges, police commence an interrogation process to uncover more information from the suspect. However, experienced criminal lawyers in Michigan warn that what is said during this time will have a significant impact on the case. While this information is generally used against the defendant, Michigan legislators are making efforts to ensure that police interrogations remain fair and transparent.

In July 2010, the Michigan House of Representatives passed a bill introduced by Representative Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, which would require the videotaping of all police interrogations of suspects accused in felony crimes. Many criminal defense attorneys support the measure, as it works to keep the system honest for both police and the suspect in question. Additionally, a video statement is a very strong piece of evidence that can work to defend or convict a defendant--making it a necessary component of a criminal trial.

<h2>Concerns have been raised regarding the bill</h2>

However, several law enforcement officials have raised concerns regarding the bill, now pending approval in the Senate. Some police officers worry that the price of the machinery is far too high, costing roughly $6,000 per police department for both equipment and training. Additionally, officials have also expressed that malfunctioning equipment could negatively impact criminal cases. Should those circumstances arise however, police are allowed to explain why the statement was not recorded, limiting any consequences.

As the Senate must decide whether this bill will pass, it is unknown whether the measure will make its way into Michigan law. Being accused of a criminal offense is a scary experience for anyone to go through, and this proposal could ensure that the rights of a suspect are protected, even during the interrogation process. Because the consequences of conviction can be very severe, it is important to contact knowledgeable and aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">criminal attorneys in Michigan</a>.
