&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A police chase that was televised on several stations around the state of Michigan has resulted in one woman facing criminal charges. </span><b>She has been charged for fleeing from the police</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it was the reason for her flight that is likely to result in some very serious additional charges.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police records show that on October 26, 2016, </span><b>the body of 19-year-old Meagan Margarette Williams was discovered abandoned in an empty lot</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Further investigation revealed that the Port Huron teen died of a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heroin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overdose and that she may have been saved if the person or people with her had sought medical help. However, she was abandoned during her overdose, and died.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after her death 28-year-old Valerie Mathews </span><b>texted a number of her friends to tell them that she had disposed of William's body</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an abandoned lot. </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were notified. They confronted Mathews, and she led them to the body. An investigation was opened, but months went by without any resolution. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days ago, officers arrived at an intersection on Detroit's east side, looking for Mathews. According to a statement released by the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayne County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Prosecutor's Office "Their investigation led them to a suspicious van. The Police followed the van and </span><b>despite the activated overhead police lights, the defendant refused to pull over.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The van continued throughout areas of Detroit and Hamtramck before the defendant exited the vehicle and tried to run."</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathews led officers on a 25 mile chase that was recorded from above by media helicopters. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">She was finally intercepted when </span><b>she pulled over and attempted to flee on foot.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A police officer tackled her while she was attempting to scale a fence. She was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed before being transported to jail.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathews, who calls herself 'VL BADD', allegedly has a lengthy criminal record which includes retail fraud, failure to pay child support, and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug possession</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the wake of the many mile police chase through Detroit and Hamtramck, she has also been charged with Third Degree </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fleeing and Eluding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, punishable by up to five years in prison. </span><b>There may be additional charges brought</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in connection with Williams' death, although the prosecutor's office hasn't announced that.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At her arraignment law enforcement officials told the court that she has multiple holds in multiple jurisdictions, including out of state warrants. </span><b>She was released on a $50,000, 10 percent conditional bond with a GPS tracking tether.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Her next court date, a probable cause conference, has been scheduled for April 13th, with a preliminary hearing to follow on April 19th.</span>
