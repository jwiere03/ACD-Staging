Throughout the state, many people who contact experienced criminal defense lawyers in Michigan are those who have been caught in possession of unlawful controlled substances. The government classifies all illegal drugs differently, putting them in "schedules" depending on how addictive they are, as well as their threat to the public. While being caught in possession of any illegal drug will subject a person to harsh consequences, a defendantâ€™s sentence will vary depending on the "schedule" level of the narcotic involved in the case.

In the past, federal law has regarded powder cocaine and crack cocaine differently--those caught in possession of crack cocaine were sentenced to more severe penalties then those caught with powder cocaine. Some people have asserted that crack cocaine is generally used by blacks while whites statistically prefer the powder. Therefore, some African American legislators argued that the disparity in the law caused social and racial problems as well.

The House of Representatives has approved a proposal that will reduce the difference in punishments for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank">cocaine possession</a>. Should the measure be enacted into law, the mandatory jail sentence for first-time offenders and repeat offenders with less than 28 grams will also be dropped.

<h2>Officials expressed their support of newly passed proposal</h2>

Many representatives and government officials have expressed their support of the newly passed proposal. According to Michigan Congressman John Conyers, the measure will put every defendant on the same level playing field. "The Fair Sentencing Act will reduce the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100-1 to 18-1," he explained. Also supporting the proposal is Attorney General Eric Holder, who placed emphasis on maintaining high, but equal, standards when sentencing those convicted of drug crimes. Hopefully, the bill will "go a long way toward ensuring that our sentencing laws are tough, consistent, and fair."

If the legislation is enacted into law, it would affect many who have been caught in possession of crack cocaine nationwide. Regardless of the potential sentence, if you or a loved one are facing Michigan or federal cocaine charges, it is essential that you immediately seek the assistance of a qualified attorney experienced in defending state and federal drug charges.
