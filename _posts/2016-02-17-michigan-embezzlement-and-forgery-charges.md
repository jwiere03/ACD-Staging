<h2>Michigan Health Care Aide Charged With Embezzlement</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Loftis, a 33-year-old former health care aide, is being charged with embezzlement and forgery after police say she stole money from the elderly man she was caring for. Authorities arrested Loftis in Troy, and she is now facing three felony counts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maurice McCollough, the man Loftis helped care for, did occasionally write checks in Loftis' name so that she could make small household purchases on his behalf. Which isn't uncommon in home care situations. But when friends and a number of other people who were all involved in his care expressed concern over checks that Loftis claimed McCollough had made out to her, the authorities stepped in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">McCollough has an account at Consumers Credit Union where, according to paperwork reviewed by law enforcement, he wrote a total of $2,250 in checks to Loftis. Money that authorities proved was in her account. Except, according to McCollough, he didn't authorize any of those checks. Which leaves the police with the distinct impression that the checks were forged.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Loftis was arrested by the Troy Police, and has been charged with a single count of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank">embezzlement</a> of more than $1,000, and two counts of forgery. According to police, the forgery was for two checks that were written between June and August of 2015, totaling $600. Under Michigan law, forgery is a felony punishable by up to 14 years in prison, while embezzlement, due to the amount allegedly taken, is a five year felony.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Loftis was returned to Branch County where the alleged embezzlement took place, although the arrest took place in Troy, which is located in Oakland County. She is currently being held in the Branch County Jail on a bond of $25,000 until her next court appearance. Her preliminary exam is scheduled for February 23rd.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement of money from the elderly and from vulnerable adults that one is caring for is considered in many cases to be <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-vulnerable-adult-abuse-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank">vulnerable adult abuse</a>. While elder abuse can come in many forms, financial exploitation is one of the more common. Thatâ€™s why, in 2012 and 2013, a whole slew of new legislation was signed into law regarding vulnerable adult abuse. For example, the law that provides for consecutive sentencing of someone convicted of multiple charges or counts of financial exploitation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, being falsely accused of stealing from a family member that you were caring for, or someone that you were hired to take care of can be devastating. After all, aside from the loss of your job and ruined relationships, there is the possibility of prison to consider. Which is why you will need an excellent attorney with years of experience handling false allegation cases. Contact The Kronzek Firm today, we can help you.</span>
