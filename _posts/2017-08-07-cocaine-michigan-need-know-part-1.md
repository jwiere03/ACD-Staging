It can be snorted, eaten, injected or smoked.[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine tends to be portrayed as a glamorous drug by Hollywood - </span><b>the illicit pleasure of the rich and famous</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike it's inelegant cousin, crack cocaine, who has a reputation for being the drug of choice for less-than-savory characters, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is often depicted as a high society alternative to alcohol. Something one uses at parties and social gatherings to achieve a delicate and enjoyable high. Something controllable and without lasting consequences. They call it snow, blow or nose candy. Yeah, right!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The unfortunate downside of this particular social depiction is that it leads people to believe that use of cocaine, especially if it's only occasional, is completely fine, when in reality it isn't. Cocaine, just like crack cocaine, </span><b>is illegal in Michigan and can get you into a world of trouble</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even having the drug with you, even if you haven't used any and may not have intended to, will still result in </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very serious criminal charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including time in a state or federal prison.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine is a schedule 2 drug in Michigan, which means that it has been categorized as </span><b>having a high potential for abuse. That</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. In fact, according to </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0fvpnpbdg2djfaca4mf5xsjw))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-333-7214"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Michigan penal code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cocaine is illegal in ANY form or derivative. "Coca leaves and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation thereof which is chemically equivalent to or identical to any of these substances"</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, cocaine is against the law in every possible form in Michigan as well as every single state in America. It is also a federal crime. So what does that mean for you? Well, it means that if you are caught using, transporting, selling, sharing or storing cocaine anywhere in the Mitten State, you may be headed off </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>Prison is a thoroughly unglamorous place where, well, you know....</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It makes no difference how classy you were before your arrest, or how much fun you had at high society parties, prison strips the class and the fun out of everything.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, we want to </span><b>answer some of your basic cocaine-related questions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and give you a clearer picture of what you're up against when you choose to use, possess or distribute cocaine in Michigan:</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is cocaine, and why does it make you high?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cocaine is a powerfully addictive stimulant, which is derived from the leaves of the coca plant. Cocaine interferes with the normal processes of the brain by flooding the pleasure-center of the brain with dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria. However, the high doesn't usually last long, depending on the method of administration.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>If cocaine comes from a plant, isn't it "safe" and "natural"?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a mistake that many people make. Just because something comes from a plant, doesn't mean that it can be safely ingested. Remember that poison ivy, poison sumac, and deadly nightshade are plants too, and no one consumes those!</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>Wasn't cocaine historically used in medicine?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Although the people of South America have been chewing the coca leaves for thousands of years, purified cocaine hydro chloride was only isolated from the plant a little over 100 years ago. It was initially used as a painkiller, and also to numb isolated areas of the body for surgery.</span>
