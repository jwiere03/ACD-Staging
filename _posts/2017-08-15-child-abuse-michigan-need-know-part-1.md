&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Child abuse is a complex and even controversial topic. In Michigan, the law is relatively specific about what constitutes child abuse, although </span><b>there are several gray areas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can, and often are, the cause of misunderstandings for many people. In this two part series, we plan to break down some of the misconceptions surrounding </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  We also explain the possible charges for people who have been accused of harming or endangering children.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First it's important to understand that </span><b>child abuse takes many forms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can be categorised as physical, sexual, and emotional or psychological, and explained as follows:</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2><b>Physical Abuse:</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical Abuse is when a parent, caregiver, or any adult in a position of authority over a child, causes </span><b>intentional injury or trauma to a child</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is the most visible form of child maltreatment, and also one of the more common varieties. Physical abuse of a child could include biting, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kicking, punching, slapping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, scalding, burning, shaking or shoving.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics show that in many cases, physical abuse is often unintentional, and result from physical discipline that gets out of hand. While </span><a href="https://abuseandneglectdefense.com/michigan-spanking-law-and-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a parent's right to physically discipline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their child is protected by the law in Michigan, </span><b>parents are cautioned to be aware of how much force they us</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">e. Adults are considerably stronger than children and can do a great deal of damage if they are not careful. The general rule of thumb here in our state is that the discipline cannot leave marks on the child’s body. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2><b>Sexual Abuse:</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal definition of sexual abuse of a child in Michigan, refers to any act of a sexual nature that involves an underaged minor. It could be the seduction of a child by a trusted relative which becomes a long-standing sexual relationship between them. Or it could be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/aiccsp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a single violent act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performed by a stranger. Either way, </span><b>both instances would count as child sexual abuse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and both are considered to be criminal acts in the state of Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexual abuse takes many different forms, and as such, there are many different statutes to cover all of the different varieties. However, regardless of how "harmless" the act may have seemed to the adult, or </span><b>how willing the minor was to participate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, any </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual contact between an adult and an underaged minor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is strictly illegal in Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexual abuse of a child could include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexual penetration (voluntary or involuntary) or inappropriate touching</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/child-molestation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Molestation</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rape</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-child-pornography-laws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child pornography</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child prostitution</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incest</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://abuseandneglectdefense.com/michigan-child-child-sibling-abuse-defense-attorney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child-on-child abuse</span></a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2><b>Emotional Abuse</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional abuse, which is also sometimes referred to as psychological maltreatment, is commonly defined as a pattern of behavior that can negatively impact the emotional, psychological or social development of the victim. It can include verbal assaults, like name calling, and also terrorizing, which usually includes </span><b>frightening a child by threatening them with harm or intentionally placing them in situations that frighten them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can also include ignoring them for prolonged periods, isolating them from family and peers, rejecting them as individuals, or neglecting their basic emotional needs. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional abuse is not technically illegal, although it is important to note that the legal description of what child abuse could entail, does include references to "mental harm". This means that if a parent or caregiver </span><b>treats a child in a way that has a lasting negative impact on them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, without ever </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">physically harming them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that person may still be charged with child abuse, depending on the circumstances.</span>
