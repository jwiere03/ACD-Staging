Regardless of occupation, being accused of criminal charges will have significant consequences, sometimes leading to job demotion or loss. Additionally, because many job applications require a criminal background check, suspects may find it increasingly difficult to secure a job as well. As aggressive Michigan criminal defense lawyers, clients seek our assistance on a variety of cases not only to clear their name, but also to prevent the repercussions to affect their livelihood. A recent case  with similar circumstances is seen in  the example of the Michigan police sergeant, demoted after setting off fireworks inside police headquarters.

In December 2009, Milan Police Sergeant Tim Casey, 45, was working the night shift when he attempted to play a harmless prank on a coworker. Police records state that he attempted rolled a firework device underneath a bathroom door, but was unsuccessful. Although the firework went off, no one sustained personal injury as a result. However, Milan Police Chief Jeff Lewis notified administrators  after viewing the in-house surveillance footage and found evidence of the mishap. The 16 year police veteran was immediately hit with Michigan criminal charges, as the firework is illegal under Michigan State law.
<h2>Charges of Illegal Firework Possession for Police Officer</h2>
While investigating within the police department, Casey was placed on paid administrative leave. However, after determining that the firework he used to prank his co-worker was a Class C device, prosecutors charged Casey with illegal fireworks possession. Even though the court dismissed the charges after he took a class and paid a fine, the Milan Police Department plans on demoting Casey, for failing to uphold the standards of the force. While he still retains his job, this would mean a significant cut in salary and pension benefits, directly affecting his livelihood.

Casey is in the process of appealing the decision, however city officials believe that it was appropriate. "(Casey) deserves to have a job and be a police officer in our community, but the shenanigans in the police station that night told me that this is not someone who should be in a leadership position," explained Milan Mayor Kim Muckler.

Being accused of Michigan criminal charges are a scary and overwhelming processes for anyone to go through, regardless of occupation. As seen by the example of Tim Casey, city-employees suspected of breaking the law automatically have several things on the line--not only could criminal charges warrant fines or probation, one's occupation can also be significantly impacted.
