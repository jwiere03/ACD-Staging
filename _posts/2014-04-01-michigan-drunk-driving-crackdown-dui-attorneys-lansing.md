<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Statewide Drunk Driving Crackdown In Michigan</strong></h2>
Law enforcement agencies in 26 counties are cracking down on Michigan drunk driving activity. Extra patrols are already on the roads, and will continue through April 7th. 144 law enforcement agencies across the state, including MSP Troopers, sheriff's deputies and city police officers, will be involved in this effort to reduce alcohol related accidents and fatalities. This crackdown is organized by the Michigan Office of Highway Safety Planning, and funded by federal traffic safety money.

A five year review of crash data clearly shows an increase in alcohol related car crashes resulting in serious injuries or death during March and early April. This time frame includes high school and college spring break, the annual NCAA men's and women's college basketball tournaments (informally known as March Madness), and of course St. Patrick's Day.

According to Michigan Law it is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or higher. However, a motorist can be arrested for impaired driving at any blood alcohol level if the officer feels that driving has been influenced by alcohol in any quantity.

Many thousands of people are arrested annually in Michigan for alcohol-related driving offenses, which include Driving Under the Influence  (DUI), Operating While Impaired (OWI), and Unlawful Blood Alcohol Level (UBAL). According to current MSP crash data, more than a third of alcohol related accidents result in fatalities. Driving drunk is very dangerous and can carry very severe penalties, including substantial fines, jail time, and the loss of your driver's license.

In 2013 more than two thousand people were arrested for drunk driving during 'March Madness'. As a result, law enforcement authorities hope to encourage sober, responsible driving by continuing to crack down on drunk drivers during this time. Avoid a drunk driving charge by designating a sober driver before you drink, or calling a friend or a cab for a ride if you have consumed any alcohol away from home.

The Kronzek Firm attorneys have had amazing success at defending alcohol related driving offenses.  Yet, the best advice we can ever give is don’t get behind the wheel after drinking.
