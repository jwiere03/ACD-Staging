The Michigan criminal defense attorneys at The Kronzek Firm PLC recently heard of a tragic case from another state. Two brothers were in the back of a police car after being arrested for <a title="Michigan Cocaine Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html">possession of Cocaine</a>. The older brother had some Cocaine hidden inside of his rectum and was worried it would be found once he got to jail. He already had a lengthy criminal record and did not want to face life in prison. Therefore, he directed his younger brother to retrieve the drugs and eat them so that the drugs would not be found. Unfortunately, soon after the younger brother consumed an estimated one ounce of Cocaine, he began convulsing and died. The older brother, who was initially charged with narcotics trafficking, was re-arrested and also charged with the<a title="Michigan Manslaughter Attorney" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-manslaughter-attorneys.html"> involuntary manslaughter </a>of his own brother.

<h2>We know that drug charges are quite serious</h2>

As top criminal defense attorneys, we know that drug charges are quite serious, especially for the harder drugs like Cocaine and Crack Cocaine. We can understand why the older brother was worried about spending years in prison if convicted of the controlled substance charge. However, we would not recommend destroying evidence of criminal activity, and especially not if doing so puts another person’s life in danger. Now, the older brother faces even harsher consequences if convicted of the homicide charge.

People charged with such serious offenses need the help of a highly-skilled <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/">criminal defense lawyer</a>. An attorney can help a defendant navigate the often-intimidating criminal justice system. Also, the attorney will work very hard to achieve a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Proven-Results.html">positive outcome</a> in the case. Don’t hesitate to contact a criminal defense attorney if you are being investigated for criminal activity, or if you have already been charged with a crime.
