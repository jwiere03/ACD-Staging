&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new bill to </span><b>ban the sale and possession of assault rifles in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been introduced in the House as part of a package of bills. The bills, proposed by Democrat </span><a href="http://housedems.com/state-rep-robert-wittenberg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Wittenberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others, are claimed by the billâ€™s sponsors, to be making the residents of Michigan safer by imposing new regulations on gun ownership and possession. Second Amendment advocates argue that if the bill becomes law, only criminals will have the illegal guns. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about his role in the proposed bills, Wittenberg agreed that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun ownership was fundamental</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the U.S. but that it shouldn't mean that residents have to accept unnecessary injuries and deaths as a result. He also said that he was proud to be a part of proposals that will "</span><b>restore common sense to our firearms legislation and protect millions of Michiganders from gun violence.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" Obviously not everyone agrees with this idea.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Senator Ken Horn has spoken out against the bill, calling it "flawed" and saying that he believes it's "dead on arrival." According to Horn, </span><b>if this bill was signed into law it would turn honest citizens into criminals overnight.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He also pointed out that laws of this nature do nothing to stop actual criminals.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation defines </span><b>an assault weapon as, among other things, a semiautomatic pistol, or semiautomatic or pump-action rifle which uses a detachable magazine, with a minimum of one additional feature.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This additional feature could include: a shoulder stock on a pistol, a protruding grip not held by the operator's trigger hand, a pistol grip behind the trigger (on a rifle), a barrel shroud, or a muzzle brake or compensator.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under this new, proposed legislation, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><b>assault</b></a><b> rifles would still be allowed to people who had owned them prior to the new law being signed by our governor.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, certain restrictions would apply, like annual storage checkups performed by the Michigan State Police. Anyone caught violating the assault rifle law would, under the proposed legislation, be guilty of a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> punishable by four years in prison, a fine of up to $2,100, or both. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the bill that will make assault rifles illegal, there were a number of other proposed changes to gun rights in Michigan. They include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making it illegal for anyone to brandish an imitation firearm, with increased penalties for those found guilty</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making it illegal for anyone to alter a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or an imitation firearm, with increased penalties for these crimes,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making it required that ballistic identification information be provided to police before certain handguns are sold to the public,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making it required that all lost or stolen ammunition be reported to police, and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making it illegal for anyone to purchase a firearm with the intention of providing it to a minor or anyone else who is </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibited from gun ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the law (eg: a felon)</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people are openly against the assault rifle bill, claiming that it will </span><b>violate their Second Amendment rights</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, there are also a surprising number of people who believe that the bill is a step in the right direction. They say that </span><b>gun control is an issue that needs to be addressed, and too many people have already lost their lives.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What do you think?</span>
