  Although the Second Amendment guarantees
  Americans the right to possess and bear
  arms, a person can still be arrested and
  slapped with criminal charges for
  bringing out a gun. A perfect example is
  seen in the recent case of a Clare
  County man who was arrested by police
  last week after drunkenly drawing a
  firearm toward two deputies.

Under the Second Amendment, all Americans have the right to own and bear arms for self-defensive purposes. Although it is an instilled liberty that many enjoy, experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers maintain that it is also arguably the most contested and debated issue within the entire Constitution. Just because one has the right to possess and use firearms, does not mean a person is exempt from criminal charges, especially if the barrel is pointed at a city-official, such as a police officer. Such are the circumstances of a recent case where law enforcement officials took a Clare County man into custody after supposedly threatening two officers with a handgun.

Last week, Michigan State Police received complaints in Arthur Township of an intoxicated man shooting off rounds. Allegedly, Gary Rhodes, 60, approached a man in a pickup truck and became engrossed in an argument with him. During their altercation, the suspect pulled out a gun and fired at the truck driver twice.

<h2>Rhodes supposedly drew his gun again</h2>

When law enforcement officials arrived at the scene, the suspect approached the two officers right away. Again in this case, Rhodes supposedly drew his gun again and became involved in another battle, this time with police. Eventually, the two deputies were able to disarm and arrest him, taking him into custody. According to MLive.com, when Rhodes appeared in court last Friday, he was arraigned on laundry list of charges, including:
<ul>
	<li>Three counts of assaulting, resisting, or obstructing police.</li>
	<li>Two counts of Michigan assault charges with a dangerous weapon.</li>
	<li>Felony <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan gun charges</a>, including a former felon in possession of a firearm.</li>
	<li>Carrying a concealed weapon with unlawful intent.</li>
	<li>Possession of a firearm while intoxicated.</li>
</ul>
Currently, Rhodes is being held on a $200,000 bond and is awaiting his next court appearance.

As seen by the example of Gary Rhodes, the consequences for employing your Second Amendment rights can be severe--if convicted, a suspect will face both legal consequences and a tarnished reputation as a result.
