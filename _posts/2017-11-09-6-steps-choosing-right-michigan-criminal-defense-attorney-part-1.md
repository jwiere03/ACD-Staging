Here are a few tips...[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right criminal attorney to meet your specific needs can be very daunting. The internet is overflowing with recommendations, and every defense attorney has a website telling you that they're the <em>only one</em> equipped to solve your problems. </span><b>But do you really know what you need?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And can you tell what type of law firm is right for you? It can be overwhelming, for sure. So lets take a look at your situation…...</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Have you been arrested in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've been arrested and charged with a crime,</span><b> then you're going to need an attorney. And quickly!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether it's </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drunk Driving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug Crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-manslaughter-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manslaughter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex Crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you are looking at hefty fines and the possibility of some very serious prison time! This is where an aggressive attorney comes in. Specifically, a criminal defense attorney. But the web is exploding with options and it's so overwhelming!  How do you choose the right one…?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Attorneys usually specialize in different types of law.</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You wouldn't go to a divorce attorney to handle your real estate, or a bankruptcy attorney to deal with your drunk driving charge. Why? Because </span><b>that's not what they specialize in</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so they won't have the experience or expertise necessary to construct a strong defense for your case. Choosing an attorney with no experience in handling the criminal charges you're facing could mean a less-than-ideal defense.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, at The Kronzek Firm we have a number of attorneys on staff. While all of them are highly capable and very experienced, several of them specialize in particular areas of law, like </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sex crime defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPS defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, drunk driving and even f</span><a href="http://www.midmichigandivorce.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amily law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is how </span><b>we're able to meet every client’s needs by working together as a team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing those with more experience in certain areas to lead and guide a defense, which ensures the best possible outcome.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Are you being charged by the state, or the feds?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the law you're accused of breaking was a state law, you'll need an attorney who can legally practice law in the state of Michigan. However, if you've been accused of a federal crime, you'll need an attorney who can defend you in </span><a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This makes a difference, because not all criminal lawyers in Michigan practice in federal court. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can seem very confusing, and we understand that. The thing to remember is that </span><b>when you're charged with a federal crime, you're being prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s office</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is different to charges brought on a state level by the prosecuting attorney of a local county.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason this matters is because when facing federal charges, </span><b>you'll be prosecuted by a U. S. Attorney. The United States Attorney's Office has far more time and resources at hand</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which means the case may be more complex and more time consuming. So be sure to select </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an experienced attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a high success rate handling federal defenses. Practicing criminal defense in federal courts is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very different</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to practicing in state courts. </span>
