&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Crime scenes are complicated places. They're busy, and messy, and crowded. Wait… crowded? Yes, of course they're crowded! Think about it….there are</span><b> police officers, detectives, crime scene technicians, family members, witnesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and you guessed it - watchers. Those curious bystanders attracted to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the flashing red and blues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and by the nosy desire to know what's going on around them. All in all, there're a lot of people at the average crime scene. But not all of them know how to handle what's going on.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Crime scene procedures can seem harsh to onlookers</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/msp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would like the clergy to step in. Sounds strange, perhaps, but there's a pretty good reason for it. According to Michigan State Police 1st Lt. Michael Shaw, for untrained people present at a crime scene - witnesses, family members and onlookers, </span><b>police procedures can seem harsh and even cruel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaving a body uncovered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for long periods of time after the death, and refusing to allow family members to collect items of value from the crime scene. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>So what can the clergy do to help at a crime scene?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how could the clergy help at crime scenes? By describing what's going on to bystanders, and explaining procedures in a less formal and more humane way. According to MSP Lt. Shaw, members of the clergy can </span><b>comfort people, while explaining what's going on</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and why officers are doing what they're doing. In essence, they serve as a liaison between </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and bystanders at crime scenes.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Clergy, he says, help to bring calm to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a stressful situation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where an officer can't. This is primarily because </span><b>they have a time sensitive job to do. It demands their complete attention</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and taking time to explain procedures and answer questions is a distraction. "Sometimes the family just want somebody to kind of lean on, and to have a shoulder to cry on. And when we’re trying to investigate, it’s hard to spare a trooper or law enforcement officer to perform that function."</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The program is already at work in parts of Detroit, and Flint</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of specially trained clergy members at crime scenes by MSP is part of a program called CAUTION - </span><b>Community Action United Team In Our Neighborhood</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Faith leaders in the communities, and members of the clergy volunteer, and are then trained by police officers to prepare them for their duties at crime scenes. Training topics include </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ministering in a Pluralistic Environment, Incident Response and Diffusing, Spiritual Resiliency, and Avoiding Compassion Fatigue.</span></i>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAUTION program aims to foster trust and improve public safety by creating a two-way flow of information at crime scenes. The program is already in place in Flint and parts of Detroit, are </span><b>officers there are equipped with lists of clergy members they can call</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when heading for a crime scene. However, MSP is hoping to expand the program to include </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/macomb-county-criminal-attorneys-macomb-michigan-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macomb</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/oakland-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-expert-lawyer-pontiac-farmington-novi-southfield.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counties in Metro Detroit as well.</span>
