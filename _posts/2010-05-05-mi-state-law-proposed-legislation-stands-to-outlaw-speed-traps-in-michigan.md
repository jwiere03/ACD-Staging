Each day as aggressive Michigan criminal defense lawyers, multiple people seek our representation for a variety of traffic violations. Often times, these individuals have received citations after being caught in an infamous Michigan speed trap--a costly situation where a police officer waits in search for a driver to travel just slightly over the speed limit, only to pull the motorist over immediately afterward. However, new legislation being proposed in the upcoming weeks, that look to force cities to follow specific formulas when deciding speed limits, and to end the practice of speed traps.

State Representative Rich Jones, a Republican from Grand Ledge is proposing a new law in the next few weeks making cities conduct thorough studies to figure appropriate speed limits, within the realm of the Public Act 85 of 2006. The legislation would force Michigan communities to conduct an engineering and traffic study to determine speed limits on city streets--the 85th percentile of free flowing traffic will decide the law.


<h2>We fully understand the point of view they are coming from</h2>

As a 31-year veteran of the Eaton County Sheriff's Department, Jones insists that honest officers never enjoy playing the role of speed trap predator. "Any officer with integrity wants nothing to do with a speed trap. They should be totally illegal, and there's no excuse for them. They're a money grab, plain and simple," he commented. The bill has the support of other legislators, such as State Representative Bettie Cook Scott, who is also a former law enforcement official. She explained that "...enforcing the law was my job. But if the law is not properly set, I think the citizens should have some redress...and if you're going to punish someone for breaking the law, then the law should be based on a solid foundation."

Being pulled over for any reason in an annoying experience for every motorist, especially when caught through a questionable speed trap. As frustrating as these occurrences may be, the consequences can still be significant, including legal repercussions or fines.
