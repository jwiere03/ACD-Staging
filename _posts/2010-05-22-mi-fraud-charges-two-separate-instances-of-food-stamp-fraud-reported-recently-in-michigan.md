Being accused of a crime will change a person's life forever, even if the person is suspected of committing a non-violent crime, including bribery or fraud. As the economy continues to dwindle, many people across the State of Michigan and the country have been accused of financial fraud in some capacity, as a scheme to make money and beat the recession. Despite the illegality of such an act, experienced Michigan criminal defense attorneys nonetheless witness many instances of fraud or bribery committed by all types of people. A perfect example is seen in two recent cases where store owners across Michigan have been charged with attempting to take advantage of the food-stamp system.

The owners of Michigan Food Center in Detroit pled guilty this week to participating in a plot to exploit money from the federal food-stamp program. According to prosecutors, the two brothers who ran the store allowed customers to use their food-stamp cards to receive cigarettes, phone cards, cash, and even an "exotic" drug called khat. By the time Hizam Mozip and Abdo Mozip were taken into custody, it is estimated that they accumulated $900,000 over three years through this illegitimate money-making scheme. Currently, they are awaiting sentencing scheduled for August 17th on Michigan fraud charges. If convicted, the brothers will almost certainly face extreme fines, as well as incarceration.


<h2>Ypsilanti fraudsters accumulated over $700,000</h2>

In a similar case, four workers at a Ypsilanti store have also been arrested for fraud involving food-stamps. According to reports from the Associated Press, the store employees in question gave cash to food-stamp participants so that they could take larger amounts from their cards. Additionally, they are also accused of helping people use their food-stamp benefits to obtain cash for overseas travel. According to the indictment against them, the Ypsilanti fraudsters accumulated over $700,000 in their plot.

As seen by the examples of both the Detroit and Ypsilanti store, fraud is a heavy offense that law enforcement officials take very seriously. Conviction of bribery or financial fraud will not only result in substantial financial fines for well over what was taken, but a person's liberties and freedoms will almost certainly be greatly limited. Because the consequences are so severe, it is essential to secure the highest quality legal defense for your case.
