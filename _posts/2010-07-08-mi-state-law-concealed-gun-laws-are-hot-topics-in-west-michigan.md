State law in Michigan forbids citizens from bringing any concealed weapon into several public places, including schools, courtrooms, child care centers, hospitals, sports arenas, or casinos. Ask any criminal defense attorney in Michigan--the consequences for conviction of gun charges can be severe and have life-changing consequences including fines or jail time. Despite the harsh penalties imposed for bringing concealed firearms into prohibited areas, it is interesting to note that although the weapons are forbidden inside the facilities, they are allowed outside the facilities.

This interesting technicality came to light during a children's soccer game in May 2010. Following the match, James Sherrill became engaged in a heated verbal confrontation with another parent. The argument became so intense that Sherrill pulled out a gun and pointed it at the other parent. Even though Sherrill has a permit to carry concealed weapons and bringing the gun to the soccer field did not violate any laws, prosecutors still charged him with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-assault-dangerous-weapon-attorneys.html" target="_blank">Michigan assault with a dangerous weapon</a>. After pleading no contest to the counts against him, Sherrill is facing sentencing for the felony charge in August.

The penalties for violating <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan gun laws </a>are no laughing matter. A first offense is punishable by a $500 fine and a six month suspension of a concealed weapon's permit. Repeat offenders will face even tougher punishments, including increased fines and significant jail sentences.

According to Muskegon County Sheriff Dean Roesler, most concealed weapons carriers have permits and are overall responsible citizens. However, many West Michigan citizens have been embroiled in debate over appropriate gun use since the laws governing concealed weapons were relaxed in 2001. Numerous people believed that permitting guns in too many public places will increase violence and bloodshed--having a concealed weapon during an argument, physical or verbal, can cause the fight to escalate unnecessarily. Citizens such as Muskegon Heights resident James Hiza states that he respects gun rights, but not the ability to bring weapons into public places. "They've got a right to keep weapons at home and protect their property, but not to carry (their weapons) out in public," he said.

<h2>Concealed weapons are allowed in too few places</h2>

However, there are those who believe that concealed weapons are allowed in too few places, given the turbulent situations that can arise from many people gathering in one location. Eric Rice explained his views to the Muskegon Chronicle. It was his opinion that large numbers of people increase the likelihood of a person needing a gun for protection, particularly at venues were situations can easily get out of hand, such as sports arenas.

Regardless of the position that West Michigan citizens take, it is very important not only to account for public safety, but also to ensure that beloved Constitutional rights are protected. As seen by the example of James Sherrill, even permit-holding carriers bringing a gun into lawful locations can be arrested for violating concealed weapon laws, facing life-changing consequences. To protect yourself and your personal liberties, it is essential to pro-actively seek the best legal defense for your case.
