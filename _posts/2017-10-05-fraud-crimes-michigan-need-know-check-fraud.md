Moving on, we're going to be taking a look at another common one here in Michigan - check fraud.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is check fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Check fraud refers to crimes involving </span><b>fake, forged or deceptive checks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These falsified checks are often used by people trying to make purchases, obtain money from bank accounts, or finance transactions. However, it's not just individuals who can be charged with check fraud. Businesses and organizations can also be found liable for check fraud.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Check fraud can include any of the following types of fraudulent activity:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forging checks</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counterfeiting checks</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-uttering-publishing-attorneys-financial-crimes-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altering existing checks</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paper hanging</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check kiting</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>How has technology changed check fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most obvious ways that modern technology has changed </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-check-fraud-law.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is simply this - by making it less common. </span><b>Checks are not used as often as they once were</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most people now use cash or credit/debit cards. Lots of us pay bills online and seldom write checks. Checks are issued more often by companies and organizations in Michigan than they are by individuals, so check fraud is now somewhat less common.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are other ways that check fraud has become more difficult to accomplish due to technological advances. For example, it is now much harder for someone to </span><b>deposit a blank paper inside an envelope into an ATM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then withdraw money against the amount of that "check" before the bank catches up with it. Many ATMs now have the ability to scan individual checks as they are deposited, and reject those that do not meet preprogrammed bank specifications.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is the penalty for check fraud in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a person is found liable in a civil action, they must pay:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full amount of the check, draft, or order;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil damages of twice the amount of the check, or $100.00, whichever is greater;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court costs of $250.00.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, writing a no-account check, which means writing a check out of an account that the person no longer has, is </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The penalty for a no-account check is up to 2 years in prison, or a fine up to $500.00, or both. Anyone guilty of writing 3 or more 'nonsufficient funds' checks in a 10 day period will be subject to the same penalty.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, anyone found guilty of </span><b>writing an insufficient funds check</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the intent to defraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is facing the following penalties:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the check amount is less than $100.00 and it's a first offense, then this is a misdemeanor with a penalty up to 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or both. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the check amount is less than $100.00 but the person has 1 or more prior convictions, then this is misdemeanor with a penalty up to a year imprisonment, a fine up to $1,000.00, or both.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors also have the option to charge a bad check writer with Uttering and Publishing. That carries a maximum penalty of up to 14 years in prison. </span>
