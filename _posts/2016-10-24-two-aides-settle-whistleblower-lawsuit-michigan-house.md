<span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallout from the </span><a href="https://www.thecleanteam.xyz/misconduct-charges-against-former-legislators-tossed-out.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courser/Gamrat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affair has been extensive, nationally publicized and embarrassing. With </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-attorney-general-refiles-felony-charges-against-todd-courser.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allegations of misconduct, people losing their jobs on both sides of the fence and even several </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/courser-gamrat-file-lawsuits-michigan-attorney-general.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ripples from this rock were huge. Now, the </span><b>two former aides to former House Representatives Courser and Gamrat have settled their whistleblower lawsuit against the Michigan House.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Allard and Ben Graham were the joint staffers for Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat during the scandal that erupted about their affair. </span><b>Both were fired in July of 2015 after attempting to expose Courser and Gamrat's affair</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and allegations about possible misconduct in office.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the lawsuit, Allard and Graham </span><b>claim that they raised issues to House Speaker Kevin Cotterâ€™s aides</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about "matters of public concern," but were dismissed. Among the issues brought to Cotter's attention were the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">affair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the fact that the staffers were required to send political emails while on the clock at work.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the lawsuit, Allard and Graham </span><b>accuse Cotter of covering up the affair and office </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html"><b>misconduct</b></a><b>, and only reporting it after the pair reported it to the press</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also allege that Cotter allowed them both to be fired without intervening. This, they claim, is a clear violation of their free speech and whistleblower rights under the law.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Allard and Graham say that Cotter, due to his party affiliation, only ordered an investigation into the Courser/Gamrat affair after the issue was made public. </span><b>The affair was revealed after the fired aides released a copy of a secret recording to the Detroit Free Press</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which Courser is urging Graham to send out an email making false claims.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The email in question is the one claiming that </span><b>Courser was discovered having sex with a male prostitute behind a popular Lansing gay bar.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was later discovered that the scandal that Courser hope to start with the email was an attempt to beat a blackmailer at his own game. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By creating unbelievable and unlikely scandals about himself, </span><b>Courser hoped to make his affair with Gamrat seem less likely, in the event that it became public.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apparently, the pair were being harassed by a blackmailer who had threatened to reveal their affair. It was later discovered during an investigation conducted by the </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/msp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that Gamrat's </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">husband </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the one behind the extortion.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>A deal was reached last week between the two former aides and the Michigan House of Representatives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then, the settlement has been confirmed by Gideon D'Assandro, spokesman for Cotter. Although we know that the lawsuit sought unspecified monetary damages, there are not currently any details available regarding the settlement amount. It will be interesting to learn how much this fiasco cost us taxpayers. </span>
