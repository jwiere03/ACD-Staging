The people of Cheboygan are most likely rather grateful to see the end to a wave of thefts - items stolen from vehicles around the city, that were apparently the work of one man who was recently arraigned on nine felony counts and one misdemeanor.<!--more-->

38-year-old Russell Erwin Vanderhill, also a resident of Cheboygan but likely one who is not so pleased with the most recent crime solving developments, is charged with four counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes" target="_blank">breaking and entering</a> a vehicle to steal property valued at $1,000 or more, but less than $20,000.

This is a felony under Michigan law, punishable by up to five years in prison and a possible fine of up to $10,000 or three times the value of the stolen property, whichever amount is greater. In addition, each one of these charges includes a habitual offender (third) or subsequent offense charge.

He has also been charged with four counts of breaking and entering a vehicle, with damage to the vehicle, which is also a felony. Like the former set of charges, it is punishable by up to five years in prison and a possible fine of up to $10,000. And finally, the single misdemeanor charge is for breaking and entering a vehicle to steal property valued under $200, for which he is being charged as a habitual offender.

<h2>Charges may not represent all of his court related troubles</h2>

But it appears that, substantial as these charges may be for Mr. Vanderhill, they may not represent the entirety of his court related troubles. Sources say that he is expected to be charged with a number of weapons related offenses as well.

The charges are the result of Vanderhill apparently being stopped by the Michigan State Police in a coordinated effort with the State Police Fugitive Team and Straits Area Narcotics Team. Following his arrest, Vanderhill was then turned over to the Cheboygan Department of Public Safety.

At the time of the arrest, Vanderhill's vehicle contained several items that were identified as stolen property. The police then obtained a warrant to search him home. Vanderhill's house apparently also contained stolen property.

It remains to be seen whether Vanderhill can break his way out of this mess as easily as it appears he was able to break into the vehicles.
