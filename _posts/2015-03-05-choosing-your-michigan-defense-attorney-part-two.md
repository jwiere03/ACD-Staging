<h2><b>Choosing the RIGHT Michigan </b></h2>
<h2><b>Defense Attorney for YOU!</b></h2>
We've discussed how to determine whether or not you need an attorney, and whether or not you are facing state or federal charges, in the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/choosing-your-michigan-defense-attorney-part-one.html" target="_blank">previous segment</a>. Next we are going to be looking at things like a Michigan Defense attorney's educational background, research, and qualities.<!--more-->
<h3><b>Determine what is most important to you</b></h3>
Obviously, the MOST important thing is having the best representation possible. That goes without saying. But beyond that, there are usually a few things that can "make or break" a professional working relationship, and you need to know what they are ahead to time.

Deciding before you even start looking for the right Michigan defense attorney what the qualities are that you most want in your legal representative will help you to eliminate attorneys that you would have a hard time working with. That makes this situation less stressful and unpleasant than it already is.

Commonly, people look for qualities like being a good listener, a willingness to hear out the client when they have concerns, and patience when explaining complex legal issues or answering questions about the case. These can make your case run more smoothly and reduce time wasted on unnecessary things like arguing.
<h3><b>Do your homework</b></h3>
Once you have chosen an attorney you would like to work with, take a little time to do your homework. Anyone can look good on their own website, but is there any other information to back up their claims?

Look at the professional memberships and legal organizations they belong to. A practicing Michigan attorney must belong to the State Bar of Michigan.  A lawyer who belongs to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) or the Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan (CDAM) are other good indicators that the attorney in question is serious about their practice.
<h3><b>Where were they educated?</b></h3>
Another indicator of a good lawyer is a good education. Find out where your attorney of choice went to get their law degree, and what degree they hold. Having a Juris Doctorate, also called a Juris Doctor, from a reputable law school goes a long way, especially if the attorney graduated cum laude (which means "with honors" in Latin).

This information should be available on every attorney's web page, along with information about where they are legally permitted to practice law. Pay attention to a lawyer’s scope of practice. While an attorney who can practice law here in Michigan can do a great job, an attorney who can practice law in both federal and state courts may have more experience and a history of handling more complex cases.
<h3><b>The importance of a face to face meeting</b></h3>
Most attorneys offer a free consultation, which allows you to meet with them before deciding to hire them. Always make use of this free consultation as an opportunity to learn more about your case, and to determine whether or not your attorney is a good fit for you. Pay attention to communication skills as these will be crucial during this process.
