<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thanks for joining The Kronzek Firm again for </span><b>our series breakdown of fraud crimes in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So far we've looked at </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-credit-card-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit card fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-embezzlement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embezzlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and tax evasion. In this next segment we're going to talk about organized retail crime in Michigan - what it means and what the penalties involve.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is organized retail crime?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When people think of retail crime, they tend to think of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shoplifting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - people sneaking a few items into their pockets or purse and leaving the store without paying. Organized retail crime is a similar concept, only </span><b>it happens on a much larger scale</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is usually done by an organized Â group of people. A single shoplifter, working alone, is not an example of organized retail crime.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, organized retail crime refers to an organized criminal ring with multiple members and one leader. Members steal items that are easy to store and resell, like </span><b>baby formula, beauty products, medicines, DVDs, and apparel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These items are then stored and/or relocated before being sold again. Because the items were stolen, the profit margin is enormous. Here in Michigan, from time to time these stolen items show up for sale in convenience stores and discount shops. Occasionally they show up in pawn shops.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is the Organized Retail Crime Act?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there is a danger to the public when purchasing items that have been improperly stored or labelled, organized retail crime is </span><b>considered to be a health hazard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Baby formula and medications that are expired, or have been improperly stored can cause severe illness and even death. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, in 2012 Governor Snyder signed the Organized Retail Crime Act, making it a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five year felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for anyone convicted of organized retail crime. This includes the theft of retail merchandise with the intent of </span><b>reselling, distributing, or transferring</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it to another retail merchant or to any other person in exchange for anything of value.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is the penalty for engaging in organized retail crime?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While shoplifting may be a misdemeanor, depending on the value of the merchandise, that is not the case for someone caught stealing retail items as </span><b>part of a larger criminal conspiracy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anyone convicted of participating in organized retail crime will be guilty of a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, a $5,000 fine, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the court usually orders the defendant to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/restitution.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay restitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to any retail merchants who were been victims of that person's criminal activity. If the owner of the stolen merchandise can't be identified, the merchandise, along with any sale proceeds, will be </span><b>subject to forfeiture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;
