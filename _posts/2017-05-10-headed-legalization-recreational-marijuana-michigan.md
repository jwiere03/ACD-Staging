Is recreational marijuana the next step?[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago, the idea that medical marijuana would be legal in Michigan was nothing more than a pipe dream to many people. And yet here we are. Nine years ago, the </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4hjm1pj0n3zqdykzpzydy1pz))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-333-26424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Medical Marijuana Act of 2008</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was signed into law. And while there has been a great deal of confusion over the years, lawmakers work to close loopholes and rewrite grey areas. I</span><b>t has been almost a decade since weed was legalized for medicinal purposes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many, however, it was only the beginning. The </span><a href="https://www.regulatemi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is hoping to add Michigan to the growing list of U.S. states that have </span><b>legalized marijuana for recreational purposes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This would mean that you would no longer need a painful or terminal illness in order to smoke marijuana or consume 'medibles' in Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>There are currently eight states in the U.S. where marijuana is legal for recreational purposes, including:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington, DC</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a petition turned in to the Secretary of State last week, the Coalition is seeking to have </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> become like any other regulated commodity in Michigan (think: alcohol and cigarettes). If the petition language is approved by the state Board of Canvassers, </span><b>the Coalition will have 180 days to collect 252,523 signatures from registered voters in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The goal however, is 300,000, which they're certain they can get.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Irwin, a former State Representative, heads up the Coalition as its political director. Irwin says that this ballot would </span><b>give the citizens of Michigan a chance to bring an end to the thousands of pointless marijuana-related arrests</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that take place every year in this state. In addition to reducing the number of arrests clogging up the courts, the petition also proposes to tax recreational marijuana sales at a rate of 16%. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>The estimated revenues from the taxes alone would be in excess of $100 million.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coalition proposes that the <strong>tax revenue generated by marijuana sales</strong> be split up as follows: 35% for K-12 education, 35% for roads, 15% to communities that allow marijuana businesses to operate, and 15% to counties where marijuana business are actually located.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the petition proposes that people be allowed to possess recreational marijuana in 2.5 ounce quantities, with </span><b>a 10 ounce limit for how much recreational users are allowed to keep at home at any one time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also suggest that the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affair (LARA) to oversee and regulate the business.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming the petition is approved, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the required number of signatures are collected, there is a still long way to go before this becomes a law in Michigan. Assuming that it ever makes it that far! Until then, </span><b>please remember that possessing even the smallest amount of marijuana for recreational purposes is still considered to be illegal in the state of Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unless you are a licensed patient or caregiver! Also remember that federal law says that having any amount of pot is a crime. </span>
