&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've been listening to the news lately, you've probably heard something about drones being flown over certain prisons in Michigan. There was </span><b>contraband being dropped into prison yards</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where prisoners were waiting with open arms. After all, it's actually happened several times this year, although not every attempt was successful. However, that fact that it's happened more than once, and in more than one location, is enough to scare the </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Department of Corrections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to press releases put out by the MDOC in August, an unsuccessful drone drop was made some time earlier this year. </span><b>Prison employees were able to intercept the dropped package </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">before any prisoners were able to get it. That however, was the only one they got to first. Another drone drop was made on May 29th. But it was two months before prison officials realized what had happened.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prisoners at Richard A. Handlon Correctional Facility were found with Alcatel cell phones, which were discovered to have come from the undetected drone drop. In reviewing past security footage, prison </span><b>officials were able to pinpoint exactly when the drop had taken place</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, all that remained of the drop contents were the phones. As Michigan State Police Detective Sgt. Christian Clute pointed out, they have no idea what else was inside the packages.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, several other drone drops have been attempted inside Michigan prisons, carrying contraband like </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, razors and cell phones. </span><b>Officials were able to intercept and seize the packages</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the contents were found by prisoners (and arrest the alleged perpetrators), but that does nothing to ease their stress. The fact that cell phones were kept inside a prison for months, undetected, has put everyone on high alert.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why, when two drones were spotted flying near the Ionia prison last week on October 4, 2017, Michigan Department of Corrections officials called in emergency responders to investigation. As it turns out, the investigation was fruitless. </span><b>The pilot was never found and the drones weren't captured</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No one has any idea who was behind the drone flight over the prison. The motive however is obvious. This was another attempt to get contraband and often dangerous items in the hands of the convicts.  </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of the drones near the prison is enough to make both the Michigan State Police and The MDOC nervous. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And who could blame them - it certainly does seem to be a problem lately, and the fear at this time is that </span><b>prisoners will be given access to harmful and dangerous contraband</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could cause an </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-manslaughter-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overdose death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cell phones that could allow a prisoner to harass a witness in their pending trial or help plan an escape, or worse - </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weapons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could get multiple people killed inside the prison walls.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The three Detroit residents currently facing charges for dropping contraband into a Michigan prison are 22-year-old Patrick Corey Seaton Jr., 33-year-old Jonathan Larawn Roundtree, and 34-year-old Daryl Steven Marshall. The trio are facing </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony smuggling charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are very serious charges. Due to prior convictions, Marshall and Roundtree are actually facing life in prison. Seaton Jr. is facing five felony counts of smuggling involving contraband delivery. Each count </span><b>carries a maximum sentence of  seven and a half years behind bars</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) controls all non-privatized airspace in the United States. Currently, there are no-fly zones in place over prisons in Michigan, which means that </span><b>only people with the certification to fly drones commercially</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can legally fly a drone over a Michigan prisons. But that hasn't stopped a host of others from trying it. Until prisons in MIchigan have complete control over their own airspace, the problem is likely to continue.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this issue, the state of MIchigan has assembled a task force to investigate issues that could result from the use of drones. The 27 members of </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57738_57679_57726-427515--,00.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unmanned Aircraft Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have met several times already to </span><b>discuss the problem and suggest solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this point they are preparing a list of recommendations for Governor Rick Snyder's office and our state legislators. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point we can expect bills to be introduced in the near future addressing the issue of drone usage in Michigan, with harsh penalties for those who make unauthorized flights over prisons, and smuggle contraband to prisoners. Until then, if you or a loved one have been accused of smuggling contraband, drug trafficking, or any other crime in Michigan </span><b>call The Kronzek Firm immediately at 866 766 5245</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
