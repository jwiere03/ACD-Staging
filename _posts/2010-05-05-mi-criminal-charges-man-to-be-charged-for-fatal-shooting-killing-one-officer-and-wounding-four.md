Being accused of homicide will permanently change a person's life forever. However, if the suspect is charged with killing a city official, such as a police officer, the punishments can become instantly more severe. Experienced Michigan criminal defense attorneys see examples like this often, such as the recent case of a man who will be charged for the results of a fatal shootout, killing one Detroit officer and wounding four others.

Law enforcement officials in Detroit responded to an emergency call from a local resident who reported that she heard gunshots next door. When police officers arrived at the scene to investigate the situation at a suspected drug house, they were gunned down by thoseÂ  inside, including 25 year-old Jason Gibson, also known as James Everet. Bullets fired from the suspect fatally hit officer Brian Huff, 42, and wounded four others. Emergency medical crews took the injured officers to the hospital, where they received treatment for gunshots. When detectives searched the house where the shooting occurred, a .45 caliber handgun and approximately a pound of marijuana were discovered.

<h2>A warrant was issued for his arrest</h2>

Everet is no stranger to run-ins with police officers. Although it is unknown whether he has retained <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">Michigan criminal defense lawyers</a>, the Department of Corrections documents show that he was sentenced in 2007 to three years of probation for trying to disarm a law official and cocaine possession. When he failed to show up for a probation meeting, a warrant was issued for his arrest in April, 2008. His latest arrest occurred in November 2009, for carrying an unlawful concealed gun, ultimately adding to the list of infractions against him. Although Everet has not been formally charged at this time, it is almost certain that he will face Michigan homicide charges for his involvement in the shooting.

Being accused of murder is a big deal, particularly if the victim was a city official, such as a police officer. Since this case hit news waves, many extreme online editorials call for the death penalty to anyone who kills a law enforcement official in the State of Michigan, as opposed to an average citizen. Because the punishments of a homicide conviction are so severe, it is essential to secure superior quality legal representation for your case.
