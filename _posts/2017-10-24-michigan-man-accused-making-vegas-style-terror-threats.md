Unfortunately, in the wake of the shooting, the associations are very sad, and very scary[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of the recent Las Vegas shootings, many law enforcement agencies across the country are on high alert. And who can blame them? </span><b>The Vegas shooting left no less than 58 people dead</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and another 400 injured, making it the most </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deadly mass shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in US history. That is probably why, when one Michigan man threatened to shoot up a Cascade Township business "like they did in Vegas" the police took the threat very seriously!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">36-year-old David Robert Seastrom applied for a job with Teleperformance, a call center operator with locations across the US, including Michigan. </span><b>Due to his criminal history, he was denied the position</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fact that he repeatedly told the company was unacceptable to him. Court records show that he called the company no less than three times to express his displeasure.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last phone conversation, Seastom is alleged to have left a message saying that he was very upset at not getting the job, and that he would "</span><b>kill you as you all walk out of work, just like they did in Vegas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.’’ He then wrapped up the call by saying, "You are all so (expletive), you don't even know who you're messing with!" Employees at the call center contacted police immediately to report the threat.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seastom was arrested, and has since been charged with Making a False Report or Threat of Terrorism" </span><b>which is a 20 year felony in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He is currently being held in the Kent County Jail on a $1-million bond. Seastrom has a prior record, which court documents describe as an "</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assaultive criminal history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" (which is the issue that started this whole situation to begin with). This includes assaulting a prison guard while serving time for a previous probation violation.. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The law in Michigan treats threats of terrorism, and false threats of terrorism as very serious crime. In fact, even if the person making the threat </span><b>had no intention of following through</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the threat, or even any way to accomplish it, they can still be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged with the crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That aside, </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">local law enforcement officers also consider threats of terror to be crimes that must be handled with severity. In this day and age, making threats is just plain stupid. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, </span><b>an act of terrorism</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is defined as any of the following:</span></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A violent felony under the laws of this state, whether or not it's committed in this state;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An act that the person knows or has reason to know is dangerous to human life; and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An act that is intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, or influence or affect the conduct of government, or a unit of government through intimidation or coercion.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's important to remember that while free speech is protected by our constitution, terror threats are not! Even if you don't mean to hurt anyone, or had no intention of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">causing damage to people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or property, </span><b>making threats that cause fear or incite chaos</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are very likely to result in criminal charges.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seastrom may not have intended to harm anyone when he threatened to shoot people as they left the call center, but </span><b>the fact that he threatened to do so is enough in the eyes of the law.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Seastrom has been bound over to the circuit court in Grand Rapids now. It remains to be seen how this situation will be handled, and whether or not this particular man is looking at a lifetime behind bars or not.</span>
