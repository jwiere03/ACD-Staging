&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in Sherlock's days, if a detective wanted to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solve a crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he had to figure it out on his own. Crime scene technology has come a loooong way in the last century though, and with every new development, someone figures out a way to </span><b>utilize this tool to solve crimes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But are these methods as foolproof as they seem? Are they as reliable as we'd hope? And can you guarantee that the results won't accuse innocents along the way? Maybe not. So the question is, it is real science, or 'junk science'?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned in one of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/common-causes-wrongful-convictions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our 2017 articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 'junk science' is listed by the Innocence Clinic as one of the main reasons behind false convictions. Which means that thousands of people have been sent to prison based on </span><b>bogus scientific theories, and the use of pseudoscientific tech</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So what are these questionable techniques and tools? Oh, just your everyday crime scene forensics….</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Brain Fingerprinting:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain fingerprinting is a highly controversial crime scene tool. This technique </span><b>measures the human brain's response to certain stimulation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, specifically, words and pictures that are flashed on a computer screen in front of the viewer. The images used by the investigators usually fit into three categories:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Items that are completely unrelated to the case (this would include everyday items like a cat or fish or tube of lipstick)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Items that are tangentially related to the case (which means they are loosely or indirectly associated with it)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And items that are directly related to the case (perhaps the knife used in </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or the gun used in an </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">armed robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The test is not meant to prove guilt or innocence, rather to prove whether or not the test subject has </span><b>information stored in their brain related to the case</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they are unwilling or unable to share. How controversial is this technique? Very, however unlike </span><a href="https://childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/faq/cps-polygraph.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lie detector results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are not admissible in court, brain fingerprinting results are! But there are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of arguments about whether or not this technique generates accurate results! The criminal defense team at The Kronzek Firm is not aware of any Michigan cases where this technology has played a part. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>3D Forensic Facial Reconstruction:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This process involves the reconstruction of a human face using only a skull, a series of muscle depth markers, and </span><b>a lot of artistic license on the part of the forensic artist</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or, in more modern settings, access to 3D facial reconstruction software and a degree in the Forensic Sciences. This technology allows an anthropologist or scientist to recreate what a person's face most likely looked like from their skull. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This technology is most commonly used to help identify the remains of people discovered long after their death, where facial recognition, fingerprinting and dental x-rays aren't available. However, it isn't considered to be one of the most reliable technologies, as it requires a lot of extrapolation and guess-work.</span>
