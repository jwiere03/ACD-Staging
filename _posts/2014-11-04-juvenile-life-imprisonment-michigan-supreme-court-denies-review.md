Last month, the Michigan Supreme Court denied a motion to review its mandatory juvenile life sentencing ruling handed down this past summer. This ruling affected those serving mandatory life sentences for offenses committed as minors.

In 2012, the United States Supreme Court ruled that juvenile life imprisonment sentences that failed to take into account elements of youth are unconstitutional. These were found to be cruel and unusual punishments. Yet, the Court never looked at whether the change should apply to those already given life sentences.<!--more-->

Due to sentencing changes over the last two or three decades, Michigan has one of the highest numbers of former youth serving out life sentences. In addition, a law enacted this past March allows the option of a life sentence, or a prison term of 25 to 60 years, for youth convicted of certain crimes, including felony murder, first degree murder, and some specific repeat sex crimes.

<h2>Fresh sentences would hurt the victim families</h2>

The office of the Michigan Attorney General stated that providing new sentences for past cases is not required. Also, fresh sentences in these cases would hurt the victim families all over again. From its summer ruling, the state's high court wondered about the accuracy and effectiveness of the trial court revisiting and reviewing these old cases for sentencing.

In addition, Attorney General Bill Schuette has argued against new sentences or parole for those affected, and has continued the fight in federal cases as well.

"In every case where a juvenile is sentenced to life in prison, a victim was already sentenced to death - forever," Schuette said. "The victim's family then grapples with the aftermath of post-traumatic stress, depression, unyielding grief, and visits to a grave."
