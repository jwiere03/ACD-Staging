<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us here at The Kronzek Firm again to talk about this highly charged subject. In the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-addiction-four-key-steps-eliminating-society-part-1.html" target="_blank">intro</a> to this series on </span><b>Dr. Calarco's list of four perspectives that would need to change in order for us to overcome drug addiction in society</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we looked at the very first one - the people. If you are only joining us now, we highly recommend that you go back and read the previous article, so that you're able to form a clearer picture of what we're discussing. Moving on, we are going to look at the next two things on the list.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The Cause:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Calarco explains that people who wrestle with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are frequently viewed as being weak-willed, unwilling to change, or even flawed in some way. This couldn't be further from the truth. </span><b>Addiction is not the result of a person's unwillingness to stop </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/analogue-drugs.html" target="_blank"><b>taking drugs</b></a><b>, or even a person's damaged or flawed personality. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, it is the reason that people take drugs to begin with according to his theory.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Dr. Calarco, a classic example is diabetes. Previously, diabetes was thought to be exclusively the result of a person's dietary choices. As a result, people often thought of those who developed diabetes as being weak-willed individuals who couldn't control their eating habits. Now, however, we know that diabetes is only partly a result of diet. </span><b>Genetic disposition plays a huge role in diabetes. Drug addiction is very similar says Calarco’s theory.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is supported by Dr. Alan Leshner, MD, a widely published Professor of Psychology who also served as the Director of the </span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Institute on Drug Abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "Drug addiction is a brain disease that develops over time as a result of the initially voluntary behavior of using drugs." Dr. Leshner goes on to explain that "</span><b>It is as if drugs have hijacked the brain’s natural motivational control circuits, resulting in </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><b>drug use</b></a><b> becoming the sole, or at least the top, motivational priority for the individual.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The Stigma:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a big one. </span><b>There is a massive stigma attached to drug abuse both in Michigan and around the world.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In part this is a result of the other three items on the list. Think about it - if the people using drugs are viewed as "dirty" and "disgusting" and the cause is viewed as a "flawed" personality and a "weak will" them it only makes sense that there would be a stigma attached to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/other-drug-crimes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substance abuse issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><b>that has to change is we want to overcome this issue or at least if we buy into these theories.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of what makes this particular issue so dangerous is that, </span><b>due to the stigma, people are often afraid to admit that they have a problem. As a result, they don't actively seek out the help that they need in order to overcome their addiction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This in turn means greater instances of overdoses and death. All in all, if people felt free to ask for help without having to fear the disappointment and possible disgust of their loved ones and family members, chances are a greater number of Michigan lives would be saved.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until we are able to look past the "mark of disgrace" that we have attached to this particular issue, we will have limited success at overcoming it in the future. </span><b>Only by allowing people to step forward and share their struggles without judgment or condemnation will they be free to get help.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Which, when you think about it, is what we really want for them to begin with. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us next time, as we look at the final item on the list of societal perspectives that need to change, and discuss how we can work towards that change. </span><b>Until then, however, if you or a loved one are facing </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><b>drug related charges</b></a><b>, whether it's for use, production, possession or trafficking, we can help you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
