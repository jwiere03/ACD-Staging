It is a simple fact that not everyone gets along with others for one reason or another. However, regardless of the altercation's cause, physically attacking a person could land the aggressor in a lot of legal trouble. According to experienced criminal defense lawyers in Michigan, not only could a person be subject to fines and probation, but significant jail time as well. Should the attacked person sustain significant personal injury or die however, the suspect could also be charged with murder. Such is the case of a Michigan woman arrested for second-degree murder after a feud over Facebook resulted in a fatal crash which killed one person and caused serious injury to another.

In the past week, Torrie Emery, 23, was arguing over a man with another woman, Danielle Booth, 20, through the social media site Facebook. Following their conversation Booth made a police report that she felt threatened by Emery's comments. Two days later, Booth's suspicions were confirmed when Emery allegedly saw her in a car while driving and proceeded to ram into her vehicle several times. To escape the attacks, the driver of the Ford Taurus, Alesha Abernathy, 21, sped through a red light eventually colliding with a dump truck.


<h2>Emery was ordered to await her preliminary hearing</h2>

A Pontiac law enforcement official witnessed the crash and followed Emery as she attempted to speed off. When she finally stopped, police discovered not only that Emery has a previous criminal history, but she was also driving with her three year-old daughter in the vehicle. Despite her medical conditions such as bipolar disorder, Emery was ordered to await her preliminary hearing in the Oakland County jail on second-degree <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">murder charges in Michigan</a>, as well as assault with intent to commit bodily harm and child abuse. If convicted of the violations against her, Emery could face anywhere between four years to up to life in prison.

As evidenced by the example of Torrie Emery, physically acting out in response to an argument can land a person in a serious amount of legal trouble. Not only are her parental rights at risk, but Emery is facing significant jail time if convicted. For those who are in a similar situation, it is essential to pro-actively seek the best legal defense possible.
