Any person accused of murder charges should be very afraid. Experienced criminal defense lawyers in Michigan can attest that conviction will have life-changing consequences, including a lengthy prison sentence. In some cases, however, the punishments can be much more severe- even including the death penalty. Although the state of Michigan was the first to outlaw capital punishment in 1847, those prosecuted for federal crimes could still face this devastating fate. Such an example is seen in the recent murder conviction of a Detroit man, who is also facing the death penalty for his role in the incident.
<h2>Bank Robbery Leads To Homicide</h2>
During a 2001 bank robbery, Timothy O'Reilly allegedly shot and killed armored truck guard, Norman "Anthony" Stephens, while he worked at the Dearborn Federal Credit Union. Almost ten years later, federal jurors in Detroit found O'Reilly guilty of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">murder charges in Michigan</a>, subjecting him to all the harsh legal consequences that accompany it. However, prosecutors are determined to take the defendant's punishments a step further. They want the court to impose the death penalty.

During the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecution is likely to present victim impact statements from Stephens' family members to help convince the jury that capital punishment is appropriate. While this testimony is limited to a certain extent, history is certainly not on O'Reilly's side--the last person executed in Michigan was also convicted of murder during a bank robbery. Nonetheless, capital punishment cases are both rare and difficult to prosecute, as the death penalty decision must be unanimous amongst the jury members. It is expected that the jury will announce O'Reilly's sentence next week, whether it be life in prison or death.

As seen by the example of Timothy O'Reilly, the consequences for a murder conviction are no laughing matter. While the death penalty is not imposed often, it is still possible, ultimately making it the most extreme punishment in existence. For the best protection of your right to life, it is essential to contact hard-working and knowledgeable <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">criminal defense attorneys in Michigan </a>immediately. Acting quickly will ensure the legal advice and legal representation needed to present a strong defense, designed to make sure the worst does not happen to you.
