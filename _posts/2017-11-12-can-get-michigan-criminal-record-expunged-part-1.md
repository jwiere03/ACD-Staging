<h2>Why would you need to have a criminal record expunged?</h2>
<a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expungement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a very exciting idea for people whose lives are burdened by the weight of a criminal record in Michigan. </span><b>The ramifications are huge for so many aspects of life!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Think about your job. Having your earning potential dictated to by a poor choice you made decades ago can be devastating. Especially when it holds you back from achieving your potential. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting a better job isn't the only part of life potentially affected, though. A criminal record can affect your </span><b>chances of getting financial aid for schooling</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional licenses for careers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even living in certain housing can be impacted by a criminal record. There’s also limitations on your right to carry a gun and to vote. But what if you could get rid of it? What if you could clear your public Michigan criminal history and start life fresh?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Information about Michigan expungements</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(0x1tb304dc1okghonfnz3rnn))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-780-621"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, certain people who have been convicted of a crime may apply to the convicting court to </span><b>have their public criminal record expunged</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means that the public record of your conviction is expunged. It </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mean that all record of your conviction is expunged. Courts, government and police will still be able to see your conviction even if it is expunged from public viewing. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for a Michigan court to grant your request to expunge, the crime/conviction in question has to meet certain criteria. Also, it's important to note that Michigan courts can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expunge Michigan convictions. They </span><b><i>cannot</i></b><b> expunge federal convictions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or convictions from other states. In addition, Michigan law places strict limits on the number of convictions that can be expunged.

<h2>What is the process for expungement in Michigan?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to apply for an expungement in Michigan, </span><b>your attorney will need to fill out a petition  and file it with the court. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court may also require other documentation. This could include a fingerprint card for the state police, a certified copy of your conviction record, and the name and address of the prosecutor involved in your case. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these restrictions, if you served time in prison, </span><b>you're required to wait five years after your release before you can apply for expungement. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you didn't serve time in prison, other waiting periods may apply. Talk to your attorney about this. They should be able to explain it in detail.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your attorney will also know the right number of copies of your application you'll need to file, and exactly what will be required by the court. You'll have a hearing where your lawyer will have to explain to the judge </span><b><i>why</i></b><b> the court should agree to expunge your public criminal record.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If there were any victims who were harmed by your crime, they'll have the right to appear in court and argue against your expungement. Law enforcement officials also have the right to argue against you application, or support it.</span>
