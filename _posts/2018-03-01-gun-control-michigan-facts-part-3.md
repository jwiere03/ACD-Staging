&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back, and thanks for joining us for the wrap up of our discussion on gun control in Michigan. We know that </span><b>firearms laws and gun control are hot topics right now</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - as they should be - and we also understand that there's a lot of misinformation floating around out there. So we've put this three part series together in the hopes of dispelling a few myths and clearing up a few misunderstandings. If you are only joining us now, we recommend you </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-control-michigan-facts-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">take a few moments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get caught up.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far we've talked about guns and schools - an obvious start, given the current situation, and also who may, and may not, own a gun in Michigan. We've also covered </span><b>whether concealed carry and open carry are legal in Michigan.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.In this final segment we're going to be looking at concealed carry more closely, and sharing some important information with you about who can get </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a concealed carry permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and what the restrictions on that permit are for Michigan residents.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Who can get a concealed carry permit in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain requirements for a Michigan resident to get a concealed carry permit, which is also called a </span><b>concealed pistol license (CPL)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Curious what they are? Here you go:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be at least 21 years of age</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be a citizen of the United States or an immigrant alien lawfully living in the U.S.  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be a resident of Michigan for at least six months prior to applying for a CPL</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have successfully completed a pistol safety training course.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must not be subject to any of the following:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An order requiring involuntary hospitalization, or involuntary alternative treatment </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An order stating that you are legally incapacitated </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/protection-orders.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal protection order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PPO)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A conditional release bond, prohibiting the purchase or possession of a gun.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An order of disposition finding the applicant not guilty by reason of insanity. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must never have been </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convicted of a felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan, or elsewhere and not thereafter had your gun rights restored</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must not have been dishonorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must not have not been convicted of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certain misdemeanor violations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the eight years immediately preceding the date of your CPL application</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are curious about the rest (yes, there are more!), then check out </span><a href="https://usgunclasses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CPL-Application.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CPL application form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which clearly explains all of the restrictions.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>If you have a CPL, can you keep your gun in your car?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a tricky one, and many people get confused about whether or not they can keep their guns in their vehicle while they're going to and from work or out running errands. In short, </span><b>yes, you are allowed to carry your pistol in your car</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but there's more to it than that! </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to legally carry a gun in your car without a CPL, </span><b>you must be carrying it for a 'lawful' purpose</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it must be unloaded, AND contained inside a closed case designed for transporting firearms, AND in the trunk of your car. If your car doesn't have a trunk, it must be kept somewhere that isn't </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/illegal-discharge-of-a-firearm-in-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">readily accessible to the people inside the car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to transport any other type of gun that isn't a pistol, in your car, there are other requirements you have to meet. For example, </span><b>the weapon has to be taken down</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as enclosed in a case, and placed into your trunk (or at least not be accessible to you.)</span>

&nbsp;
