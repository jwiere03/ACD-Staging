&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we start, we'd like to address the question: "should you accept a plea bargain or go to trial?" We need this to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">completely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clear - ONLY YOU (with the guidance of your attorney) can reach that decision! </span><b>Every case is different. Every defendant is different. Every prosecutor is different</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is no one-size-fits-all answer that works for every case. However, it's a question that comes up in most criminal cases, so we'd like to share some information with you about what's involved</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people's idea of what a defense lawyer does comes from TV shows and movies. In a nutshell, a few jail visits followed by passionate arguing in court during the trial. And that's certainly part of it. But </span><b>not every case ends up in trial</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most are resolved long before that, with what's known as a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plea bargain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, because plea bargains don't usually make for good television, they don't get nearly as much screen time. So people tend to know less about the process.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the US Federal Court data, more than 90% of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony cases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> end with some type of guilty plea. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That means less than 10% of federal criminal cases actually go to trial. So statistically, </span><b>plea bargains happen far more often than trials</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Why? Because they are cheaper than trials (both for the defendant and for the government) and because in many cases, a plea bargain offers the certainty of less time behind bars, as opposed to the uncertainty of trial (which could result in a LOT more!) </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some plea bargains involve no time at all behind bars. However, accepting a plea bargain offers a criminal defendant </span><b>more control over their own case</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than leaving the sentencing decisions totally up to the judge. Of course the downside to a plea bargain is that there is no trial and no chance for a not guilty verdict. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does this work? Well, let's look at plea bargains in our state courts. Say an unarmed Michigan resident is accused of breaking into someone's home, stealing some cash and a laptop, and then trying to sell the stolen items on Craigslist. They're </span><b>charged with several felonies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including: </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking and Entering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Intent to Commit a Felony or a Larceny Therein (10 year felony), and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/2nd-degree-home-invasion-michigan-second-degree-home-invasion-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Degree Home Invasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (15 year felony).</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, if convicted, the defendant is looking at many years in prison. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sentences would usually be served concurrently with the maximum time in prison being 15 years to be exact, So, should they go to trial, or should they accept a plea bargain in the hopes of getting off with a shorter prison sentence? </span><b>The answer to that is… it depends</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Is the defendant a young person hoping to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep their record clean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to avoid screwing up future job opportunities? Or are we dealing with a retiree in poor health whose main concern is their health behind bars?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they a repeat offender with a long and varied criminal history, or someone who's never had so much as a parking ticket on their record? Is the evidence against them pretty solid, or is the prosecution's case full of holes? Did the cops </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">handle the arrest by the book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or are there questions about protocol and chain of evidence? There are </span><b>so many factors that would affect the decision</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about whether or not the case should go to trial, or a plea bargain should be worked out. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, plea bargains take the form of sentence bargaining or bargaining about the specific charges. Sometimes plea bargains involve </span><b>both a reduced sentence and reduced charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Often time, the strongest criminal defense attorneys get the best plea offers. That’s one reason that we always tell you the right attorney is critical. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, only you can make that final choice about accepting a plea offer. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because you have to live with the consequences of that choice. Your attorney can advise you (a good attorney will provide </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> valuable advice that you should listen to) but </span><b>the final decision still lies with you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the best thing you can do, if you're arrested and charged with a crime, is to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/reviews-testimonials-clients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get the best lawyer available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to you. It's one of the few parts of this process you can control. And often one of the most important!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or a loved one have been arrested and charged with a crime, what you do next can have a huge impact on your future.
