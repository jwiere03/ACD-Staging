<h2 dir="ltr">Macomb County Arrests</h2>
Three men have been arrested in Macomb County, MI on a variety of charges after soliciting sex over the internet from detectives operating under cover. Apparently one of the men told detectives that he would pick up a few of his friends and bring cocaine, which he called "snow" in the exchange, to trade for sex.

The men in question were Johnny Johnson, aged 44, and Darrel Williams, aged 43 of Detroit, and Leslie Rockymore, aged 51, of Eastpointe. Rockymore is a former captain of the U of M basketball team. He played for the Wolverines from 1981 to 1985, captaining the Big Ten Championship team through 57 games.

Detectives were waiting for the trio when they arrived at the prearranged location, and they were immediately arrested. Officers found drugs in the car, including cocaine and crack, and a 40-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson handgun. Arrests were made by the Macomb Area Computer Enforcement Team and the sheriffâ€™s Special Enforcement Team.

Rockymore and Johnson were arraigned on charges of controlled substances delivery which is a felony punishable by up to twenty years in prison. They were also charged with a felony firearms offense, soliciting prostitution and using a computer to commit a crime. Williams was charged with soliciting prostitution and having an open alcohol container in the car.

Rockymore and Johnson's bail was set at $15,000, and Williams was granted a $2,000 bond. The men were arraigned in 41B District Court in Clinton Township on Tuesday and are expected back in court on April 21st.

According to Michigan law, a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html">felony firearm</a> conviction requires a mandatory two-year minimum prison sentence for first offenses and a mandatory five-year minimum prison sentence for second offenses. Soliciting the services of a prostitute is a misdemeanor under Michigan law. In addition, people convicted of certain prostitution related crimes may have to register as a sex offender.
