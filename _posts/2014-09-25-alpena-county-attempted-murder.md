<h2><b>Stand-off with Police Ends in Arrest</b></h2>
Douglas William Howay, a 57-year-old man from Ossineke, is facing very serious felony charges after he allegedly attempted to assault members of his own family with weapons and then engaged police officers in an armed standoff that lasted through the night.

According to the testimony of his relatives, they were at home on Saturday evening when an argument erupted and Howay chased after them with a metal pipe and a rifle.  The potential victims were able to get away and called 911 to report the incident.

Michigan State Police Troopers were dispatched to the home in Ossineke, but when they arrived, Howay refused to come out of the house. Instead, he barricaded himself inside with his rifle and refused to cooperate with the officers, threatening them repeatedly.

The standoff lasted all night, and Howay finally came out at about 8 am in the morning. He was unarmed and, after a short struggle with officers, he was immediately arrested and taken to the Alpena County Jail. Police say that Howay's mother, who is confined to a wheelchair, was in the house with him the entire night, but is unharmed.

The Michigan State Police were assisted by the MSP Emergency Support Team, who were called in during the course of the standoff, and deputies from the Alpena County Sheriff’s Office. After the arrest, officers seized several weapons and ammunition from the property.

Howay has been arraigned and is charged with a single count of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html">attempted murder</a>, which is a felony, and three counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html">felonious assault</a>. He is being held on a $1 million bond, and is still in jail, as neither he nor his family is able to post the bail.

Under Michigan law, attempted murder is punishable by any number of years, up to life in prison. Felonious assault is punishable by up to four years in prison and a possible fine of up to $2,000, or both.
