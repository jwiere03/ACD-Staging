On Tuesday, January 17, 2012, two male students at Hastings High School in Hastings, Michigan (Barry County) were arguing over text messages about a girl. The students met in a school hallway and began tussling. A teacher walked up and demanded the boys stop fighting, threatening to throw her hot tea on them if they did not stop. When the boys did not stop, the teacher showered the boys with the hot tea. That broke up the fight.


<h2>Both teacher and one of the students face assault charges</h2>

Later that evening, one of the boys went to the Hastings Police Department to file a complaint against the other boy. He told officers about the teacher throwing hot tea and showed them marks on his shoulder that are consistent with burn marks one would get from hot liquid. The Hastings Police Department plans on forwarding the results of their investigation to the Barry County Prosecutor's Office. Both the teacher and one of the students face <a title="Michigan Assault Charges and Laws" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html">assault charges</a> and could spend up to 93 days in jail or possibly more, depending on the specific charge.
