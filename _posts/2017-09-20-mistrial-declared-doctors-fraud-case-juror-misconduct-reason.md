&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A mistrial has been declared in the case of Dr. Demian Naguib, a doctor formerly practicing in Port Huron, Michigan. Dr. Naguib's trial began on Monday, in the </span><a href="http://cc.ingham.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingham County Circuit Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But by mid morning the very next day, </span><b>the presiding judge declared a mistrial</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing juror misconduct as the reason. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Naguib's offices were housed in </span><b>the Neurology Clinic of Michigan, which was raided by authorities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after an investigation revealed some potentially disturbing facts. According to information provided by the Attorney General's Office, the investigation was a joint effort conducted by the Attorney General, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The indictment reveals that Naguib is accused of billing Medicaid, Medicare, and Blue Cross Blue Shield for a number of </span><b>costly procedures that were either not done, or were completely unnecessary</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The reason cited for these actions, according to the indictment, was for financial gain. As a result, the doctor is now facing charges for allegedly </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-racketeering-attorneys-continuing-criminal-enterprise-rico-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a Criminal Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nine counts of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-insurance-fraud-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid Fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and nine counts of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/health-care-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Care Fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of which are felonies under Michigan law. In addition to these felony charges, Naguib was sanctioned by Michiganâ€™s Licensing and Regulatory Affairs officials. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Very little information is available about what happened that led to suspicions of juror misconduct in this case. However, for those of you who may not be sure of what juror (or jury) misconduct even means, let's break it down: Juror misconduct is when </span><b>the law of the court is violated by one or more members of the jury</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while a court case is in progress, or after a verdict has been reached. Misconduct can refer to several different things, including: </span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication with outside non-jurors during deliberations</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One or more jury members attempting to intimidate others into voting a certain way</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurors discussing the case outside of the jury room</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurors bringing in outside information not given to them at the trial</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurors listening, reading or viewing news reports about the case</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We don't know what the individual or individuals on the jury in this case are accused of doing that was in violation of acceptable court procedure, but as you can see, </span><b>the duties of jurors are taken very seriously indeed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are many things that could count as jury misconduct, and any one of them could get the entire case thrown out.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to mention here that jury misconduct is not the same thing as </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-jury-tampering-defense-attorneys-michigan-criminal-defense.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jury tampering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Juror misconduct refers to unacceptable actions made by members of the jury itself, while jury tampering refers to </span><b>someone on the outside attempting to influence the jury</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their decisionmaking process. It can also refer to retaliation against jurors for performing their civic duty is prohibited by law. Jury tampering is illegal in Michigan and can result in serious penalties.</span>
