Don't worry - we've got this![/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You thought we'd forgotten, didn't you? Forgotten your next installment of legal jargon, when everyone knows it's your favorite article series on this blog. Well, for goodness sake, why on earth would we go and do a thing like that? So…. tada! Here it is! </span><b>The wait is over. You can now go back to stuffing your face with caramel corn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and marathoning round-the-clock episodes of </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096056/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crime &amp; Punishment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the comfort of your newly acquired legal knowledge.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Missed out on our series from the start? No biggie, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/legal-jargon-word-mean-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can catch up here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for those of you who've been with us from the start, perhaps you're getting a little tired of Latin? Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. So for this one we're keeping it strictly English - ish. Mostly.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Motion in Limine:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two out three isn't bad, right? 'Limine' is a Latin word meaning "at the start" or directly translated - "on the threshold." But the other two are, obviously, English. A motion in Limine means a motion filed by a party to a litigation. A motion is a request to the court to do something or to prevent something from being done.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if a woman in Detroit is accused of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violently murdering her cheating husband</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a hammer, her defense attorney may file a motion in the court to exclude the photographs of the crime scene. Although the pictures show the true nature of what happened, they might be so gruesome and disturbing that the defense attorney may be concerned that they could unduly prejudice the jury against his client. Therefore, not showing the pictures as evidence means that the jury is less likely to be emotionally influenced in their decision. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Inculpatory Evidence:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All English on this one. Not even a little bit of Latin. (And you thought we couldn't deliver! Tsk tsk.) Anyway, inculpatory evidence means evidence that proves that a defendant did in fact commit the crime they are accused of. In other words, evidence that helps to establish guilt. So if a man from Grand Rapids is accused of shooting and killing his business partner, finding a gun in his nightstand that fires bullets with striations that match the one extracted from the dead partner would count as inculpatory evidence.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Exculpatory Evidence:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup, you guessed it. In the same way that 'include' and 'exclude' are opposites, 'inculpatory' and 'exculpatory' are opposing sides of the same coin. So while inculpatory evidence is evidence that goes toward proving a person's guilt, exculpatory evidence goes toward proving their innocence. For example, let's say a guy from Saginaw is accused of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robbing a gas station at gunpoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Battle Creek, at 10 pm on a Wednesday. However, the defense produces a witness that saw him drinking beer at a bar in  Kalamazoo at 10 pm on that same night, the witness' testimony would be exculpatory evidence.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Subpoena Duces Tecum:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so this one's Latin… sorry, we couldn't help it! But we bet you don't know what it means. Literally translated, subpoena duces tecum means "under [threat of] penalty [of punishment] you will bring [it] along with you." In other words, not something to be taken lightly, if you're on the receiving end.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The word 'subpoena' is a commonly used term, that many people know means a command, issued under the authority of the court, for a witness to appear before the court and provide testimony. A subpoena duces tecum is slightly different. It's also a court order, but in this case for a witness to appear and provide tangible evidence. This could include documents, photographs, or any other physical item or items that could be used as evidence.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So there you have it - you're next installment of </span><b>super-useful and interesting legal terms and jargon</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because watching hours of The Good Wife is way more fun than organizing your bedroom closet like you promised yourself you would. (Don't lie - you know you said you would, right after this next episode ends, right?) At least this way the only confusing thing is that pile of single shoes at the back of the closet, and not the dialogue in your new favorite show. You're welcome.</span>
