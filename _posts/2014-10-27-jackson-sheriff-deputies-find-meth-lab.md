As is often the case, where one thing leads to another and the result isn't quite what you expected, a domestic assault call turned into an outstanding warrants arrest and the discovery of a meth lab.<!--more-->

According to the Jackson County Sheriff's Department, at about 3:30 pm on Monday, October 20th, deputies responded to a report of a domestic assault taking place in a home on Turnbridge Road in Summit Township. Upon arrival, the officers identified the male involved, and realized that he was wanted on three outstanding warrants - one felony and two misdemeanor.

After arresting him, officers searched the property and discovered an inactive meth lab. They also found an assortment of methamphetamine making components on his person. In addition, other items used in the production of meth were found on the property. These included lithium batteries, ephedrine tablets, and Coleman fuel.

<h2>Meth labs should only be dismantled by trained professionals</h2>

According to Jackson County Undersheriff Chris Kuhl, the Jackson Narcotics Enforcement Team (JNET) was called to safely dismantle and remove the meth lab. Only a trained professional should ever attempt to dismantle a meth lab, as the components are toxic and highly volatile.

Deputies also discovered a great many needles in the home containing an unidentified substance that Michigan State Police Detective Lt. Dave Cook of JNET says he suspects may be heroin or methamphetamine oil. Also uncovered on the property was what appeared to be about 1/10 to 2/10 of a gram of completed meth. It was stored in a cardboard box on top of the fridge.

Police are saying that the 24-year-old woman who reported the initial assault that resulted in officers entering the property, could not have been ignorant of the widespread drug use and production in the home. For this reason, she was also arrested.

Both suspects are currently in custody at the Jackson County Jail. The county prosecutor's office has been asked to charge the male suspect with possession of methamphetamine, delivery or manufacture of methamphetamine, phone tampering and domestic assault. The woman is being charged with related meth crimes.
