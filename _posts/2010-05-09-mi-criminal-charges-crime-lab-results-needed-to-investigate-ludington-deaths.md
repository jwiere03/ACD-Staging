Whenever investigating any unlawful situation, law enforcement officials often rely heavily on results from laboratories that provide insightful information into the details surrounding the incident. Such data is used to not only determine what exactly occurred during a crime, but also who is responsible. Experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers see many cases throughout their careers in which an investigation is placed on hold until lab tests have been conducted and the results returned, as it is difficult for anyone to proceed without such information. The circumstances are similar in a recent example, where Ludington law enforcement officials investigating the death of a young girl last week have came to a standstill, waiting on crime laboratory data before they may piece together the details.

On the morning of April 28th, Kelly Stoudt awoke to a startling sight--she found an acquaintance, James Belanger, 39, stabbing himself repeatedly in her home, while her daughter Chloey lay dead nearby. She immediately phone 911 and police officers rushed to the Stoudt residence, discovering both bodies right away. Although seven year-old Chloey was pronounced dead at the scene, Belanger was rushed to the hospital to receive treatment for multiple stab wounds. He also died shortly after arriving at Memorial Medical Center, near Ludington.


<h2>No conclusions can be made until results have been returned</h2>

An autopsy revealed that the young girl died of "asphyxia by suffocation," while Belanger died of a "stab wound to the heart." Although investigators discovered this information right away, law enforcement officials must wait to receive crime laboratory and toxicology reports before they can come to any conclusions about what occurred between the two victims. The family of the young girl believes that Belanger raped and murdered Chloey, before killing himself. Even though Dr. Marc Keen, Mason County Medical Examiner, has the same suspicions as the Stoudt family, he firmly stated that no conclusions can officially be made until the results have been returned. It is at that time, that police officers may proceed conducting a fully informed investigation.

This case in particular highlights the importance of having all the information regarding a case before piecing together the details. Although the post-mortem circumstances seem to tell one story, the crime laboratory results may paint a very different picture. For anyone accused of a criminal charge, it is this evidence that can significantly help or hurt your chances in the court room--this data can prove innocence or confirm guilt. Whatever the results may be, the most important step a suspect can take is to contact hard-working <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank">Michigan criminal defense attorneys</a>, for the highest quality legal advice and legal representation. Acting quickly is essential to making sure that any results, positive or negative, from a crime or toxicology laboratory do not result in the forfeiture of beloved personal liberties and freedoms.
