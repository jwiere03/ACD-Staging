Just in case you were curious.[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, well, well, someone thought we'd packed up and abandoned them. Oh ye of little faith! We would never just rush off and </span><b>leave you without your regular jargon fix!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What kind of monsters do you take us for? Got no idea what we're talking about? Well, jeez Louise, you've got a lot of catching up to do so why are still reading this article? </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/legal-jargon-word-mean-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go back to beginning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and don't pass go and you don’t collect $200! </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the rest of you, let's get this show on the road! We know how much you hate lying around on the couch amidst piles of unfolded laundry, watching old reruns of </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry Mason </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and having no idea what's going on. </span><b>Who are we kidding? You don't even know who Perry Mason was</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Do yourself a favor and Google him. But do it later. Right now we're about to disseminate some jargon!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Stare decisis: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a tricky one. </span><b>It looks like English, but actually it's Latin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But 'stare' is an English word, you say. After all… "I stare through my window pensively, wishing I understood all of that Latin gibberish." Yes, yes, we know. Like we said, it looks like English, but it isn't. It this case, it’s pronounced like star-ee. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case 'stare' means 'to stand by' or 'to stand on'. And what are we standing by, or on, for that matter? </span><b>Well, the 'decisis' of course</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Which means 'decision' for those of you who slept through your Latin classes. Good grief! Do you mean to tell us that you never took Latin classes? Not even one? Heavens, what is the world coming to these days?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, 'stare decisis' means to stand by the decision that was made, or to stand by an issue that's already been decided. In a legal sense, it refers to </span><b>adhering to precedents of earlier cases as sources of law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-court-of-appeals-says-no-video-sentencings.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the court has already ruled on an issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, other cases involving the same issue must receive the same response from that court. or lower courts. In other words, sticking to your guns.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Tort: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nope, you're thinking of a torte (which is delicious, certainly, but has no place in the law.) Although just in case you were wondering, </span><b>we never say 'no' to cake of any kind</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">…. ahem, hint hint….</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbelievably, 'tort' comes from the Latin word tortum, which means 'wrong.' So no, sadly it has nothing to do with cake. (Unless you think there's something wrong with cake. As if!) A tort is a civil </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-arson-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">illegal or wrongful act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that</span><b> results in someone being injured</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It could be either accidental or intentional. An intentional tort, such as </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-check-fraud-law.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or slander, can be a crime. Tort law is one of the largest areas of civil law.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Wobbler: </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you're thinking of jello. You really need to get over this food fixation of yours! This is legal jargon, people, not kitchen jargon! Get with the program! Anyway, </span><b>a wobbler is actually not a legal term</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it is used within the legal community to refer to a crime that can be classified as either </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a felony or a misdemeanor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In other words, a crime that could be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the particular circumstances of the offense, the defendant's criminal record, and several other factors.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of this would be if a Grand Rapids woman was charged with assault after getting into a fight with her friend at the bar. If she had no prior criminal record, only used her fists, and no one was severely injured, </span><b>chances are she would be facing a misdemeanor assault charge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in this case, because </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/defenses-to-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our fictional bar fighter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has two priors for assault, and used a pool stick to beat her friend senseless, the charge gets upped to a felonious assault. The difference is a possible 93 day sentences versus a possible 4 year prison sentence. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other examples of possible wobblers in Michigan, besides assault, would include: retail fraud (shoplifting), drunk driving, drug charges. malicious destruction of property, and </span><b>fleeing and eluding police</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that's it for now folks. Oh, don't worry, we'll be back with more later on. We would never leave you in the lurch, staring cluelessly at endless episodes of </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1717455/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wondering what the heck is going on. Although, if we're going to be honest about it, </span><b>British legal dramas are confusing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even if you already know all the terminology! (And what's up with those wigs?)</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious about a word we haven’t got to yet? Don't worry, there's literally no end to the interesting legal terminology used by lawyers and courts (especially in TV shows!). Until then, </span><b>if you or a loved one have been accused of a crime in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you'll need an experienced defense attorney to fight for your wobbler to lean in the misdemeanor direction, and not the other way!
