<h2><b>Cyclist Dies in Hit-and-Run Accident </b></h2>
Bruce Randall Christy Jr. of Columbus, MI, is facing multiple criminal charges, both felonies and misdemeanor, in the hit-and-run death of a bicyclist from Lenox Township. The Macomb County Prosecutor's Office has charged the 30-year-old with failure to stop at the scene of an accident resulting in a death, unlawful use of a license plate and attempted resisting and obstructing of a police officer.

Melanie James, a 25-year-old Subway worker from New Haven, was riding her bicycle along Gratiot road the night of May 22, on her way home from work, when she was struck by a 1990 Chevrolet Geo Tracker driven by Christy. Apparently Christy stopped his car and got out, but then fled the scene on foot.

Sheriff’s deputies, along with officers from Chesterfield Township and Richmond worked together to conduct an exhaustive search of the area. The search covered a three mile area, through wooded areas and subdivisions. Christy was finally found, hiding in the back of an unlocked recreational vehicle, lying under a blanket and wearing only his underwear.

The Geo Tracker, which belongs to Christy’s parents, was not legally registered, and police have found that the license plate attached to it was registered to another vehicle.

According to court records, Christy is on probation after being found guilty of failure to pay child support in July of last year. He had been sentenced in Macomb County Circuit Court to five years of probation and was ordered to pay $15,000 in back child support. Court documents also show that he has a 2009 St. Clair County conviction for property destruction.

Failure to stop at the scene of an accident resulting in a death is a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and possible fines of up to $10,000.00, or both. Resisting or obstructing a police officer is also a felony and is punishable by up to 2 years in prison and possible fines of $2,000.00, or both.

Christy is in the Macomb County Jail on a $50,000 interim bond. His arraignment was held on Tuesday, the 27th of May, in the Macomb County District Court.
