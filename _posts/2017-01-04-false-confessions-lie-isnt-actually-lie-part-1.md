&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Innocence Project, </span><b>more than 1 in every 4 people who were wrongly </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><b>convicted</b></a><b> of a crime and were later exonerated by DNA evidence, made a false confession</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That's over a quarter of the total. How did that happen? Why would an innocent person confess to a crime they didn't commit? The answer to that question is not a simple or straight forward one, but it is one that needs to be addressed.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, however, one key element present in almost all false confessions, says the Innocence Project. That key is the belief that "</span><b>complying with </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><b>the police</b></a><b> by saying that they committed the crime in question will be more beneficial than continuing to maintain their innocence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." Unfortunately, this never works in the favor of the accused, as they are essentially signing away their innocence and in many cases, their future.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger question that we keep coming back to is 'how.' </span><b>How do the police get an innocent person to admit to a </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><b>crime</b></a><b> they didn't commit?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The results of an interesting study, published in 2015, address this issue by providing chilling answers to this question.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Constructing Rich False Memories of Committing Crime", published by Psychological Science, was researched and authored by Dr. Julia Shaw and Dr. Stephen Porter. It reveals a frightening reality in which our memories are not always our own. And </span><b>it's not just that our recall cannot be trusted, but that it can be manipulated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Changed. Created new out of whole cloth under the expert instruction of an interrogator. Criminal defense lawyers at The Kronzek Firm have studied false confessions for many years. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Shaw and Porter, "</span><b>Full episodic false memories of committing crime can be generated in a controlled experimental setting.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" This is terrifying and also somewhat unbelievable. How could someone remember </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committing a crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they didn't, in fact, commit?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you ask Shaw and Porter, the answer is: easily enough.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In their study the pair </span><b>interviewed college-aged students, 70% of whom came away convinced that they had committed a crime that they weren't actually guilty of.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Each participant sat through three, 45 minutes interviews during which time Shaw used </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggestive memory-retrieval techniques to convince each participant of their fictional </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impossible, you say? Unfortunately not. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with basic background information that Shaw had gleaned from family and friends of the participants, she began the process. </span><b>She extracted information from each participant about one factual experience that they actually recalled, and one fabricated experience that she had convinced them of. </b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few hours later, the students began to create the details of those </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their own minds, stitching together memories of an event that never happened. </span><b>Some recalled the false events with such clarity that they were able to "recall" details that Shaw didn't even ask about.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In one girl's case, she even recalled the hair color of the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-resisting-obstructing-attorneys-resisting-arrest-assaulting-police-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arresting officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That's right. She remembered the hair color of the fictional officer who never actually arrested her because she was never arrested. Our own criminal defense attorneys in Michigan have replicated this very scenario in the courtroom to show the jury how it can be done. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, once people believe something to be true, </span><b>their imagination begins the process of filling in the details and creating the surrounding memory to support the belief.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So the catch is getting someone to believe something. Something that they know to be false. You would think that would be impossible, and yet it happens regularly. Once a skilled interrogator understands the technique, it becomes much easier to do. Truth be told, police officers are trained, skilled and expert in questioning suspects. Curious? Try Googling “Reid technique of interrogation.” You’ll see what we mean.</span>
