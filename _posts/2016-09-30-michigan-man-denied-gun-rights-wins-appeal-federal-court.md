<span style="font-weight: 400;">While it may appear at first glance that this story could only be important to the man whose federal appeal earned him the right to carry a weapon in Michigan, </span><b>the implications are huge for people all over the nation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You might wonder how one man's federal appeal impact your life or the lives of others in the U.S? The answer, it turns out, is</span><b> critical for everyone who has ever been diagnosed with a mental illness and yet hopes to exercise their Second Amendment rights</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">74-year-old Clifford Tyler of Hillsdale, Michigan believes that his Constitutional right to bear arms was violated by a federal law that forbids those who have been admitted to a mental hospital, from </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning guns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the surface, it may appear to be a smart law that protects the majority from a possibly dangerous minority. But that is never the full picture.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1985, Tyler's life as he knew it, fell apart. His wife ran off with another man. She burned through the couple's saving account, and then filed for </span><a href="http://www.midmichigandivorce.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">divorce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tyler was struggling with despair, as would any normal person in his shoes. </span><b>His daughters, fearing for his mental health during this dark time, expressed concerns that their father may be a danger to himself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Tyler was hospitalised under court order for a minimum of two weeks. From there however, the story gets better. Tyler was deemed safe, and released from the hospital. He went on to overcome his depression. He continued to work for another twenty years. Fourteen years after his first wife left him, he fell in love and remarried. However, </span><b>that two week span in hospital continued to haunt him decades later</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to his brief and possibly unnecessary hospitalization in the mid eighties, Tyler was </span><b>forbidden by federal law to own a gun</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2011 Tyler attempted to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase a gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but failed the FBI test due to "mental illness." Â He felt that was a violation of his Second Amendment rights. Tyler </span><b>took his case to the United States District Court of Appeals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The case turned out to be an important enough issue that a total of 16 judges weighed in on the decision.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, it was decided that the ban on Tyler's ability to own a gun was a violation of his Second Amendment Constitutional rights. In the leading opinion, Federal Judge Julia Smith Gibbons wrote that "</span><b>There is no indication of the continued risk presented by people who were involuntarily committed many years ago</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and who have no history of intervening mental illness, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felon-possession-firearm-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or substance abuse."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every judge on the panel agreed with the decision, though. Judge Karen Nelson Moore wrote in her dissenting opinion that "The government has demonstrated that (the law) is substantially related to Congress' objectives of </span><b>reducing the substantial homicide and suicide rates caused by firearms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The case has been sent back to the United States District Court in Grand Rapids, MI, where </span><b>the federal government is now tasked with having to determine whether or not a lifetime weapons ban on Tyler is the right choice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or the wrong one. As defense attorneys who believe strongly in protecting the individual rights of citizens, we sincerely hope that Mr. Tyler </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Gun-Right-Restoration.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gets his gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
