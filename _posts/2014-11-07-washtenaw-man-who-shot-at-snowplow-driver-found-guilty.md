Bevan Wilson, a 39-year-old man from Pittsfield Township, was recently found guilty by a jury of his peers in the Washtenaw County Trial Court for having fired a pistol at a snowplow driver last winter. But how did that come about, you may wonder?

No one ever said being a snowplow driver was a dream job. It's cold, and the hours are tough, and your income is wholly dependent on the weather. But under normal circumstances, you can go to work assured that no one is going to shoot you while you're working.<!--more-->

Although, this was not the case for Ben Clink, who got up and went to work in the early morning hours of February 17th to plow snow that had fallen the night before. Four inches had accumulated at the Valley Ranch Apartments on Oak Valley Drive in Pittsfield Township.

<h2>Clink had allegedly piled up the snow behind his wifeâ€™s car</h2>

Clink works for Clink Landscaping, the private company that is contracted by the apartment complex to deal with the snow. According to Pittsfield Township police Deputy Chief Gordy Schick, Wilson became angry because Clink had allegedly piled up the snow behind his wife's car. First he yelled at Clink. Then he shot at him through the window of the snowplow, shattering the windshield.

Police say that following the incident, Wilson turned himself in to the officers who responded to the scene, and submitted his weapon to arresting officers. He apparently does have a concealed weapon license but, by law, having a permit to own and carry a gun doesn't give anyone the right to shoot at other people who aren't complying with your wishes.

According to court records, after the October 23rd trial, the jury found Wilson guilty on three counts, namely: assault with intent to cause great bodily harm, <a title="Michigan Assault With a Dangerous Weapon Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-assault-dangerous-weapon-attorneys.html">assault with a dangerous weapon</a>, and commission of a felony with a firearm.

Wilson is scheduled for sentencing on November 19th in the Washtenaw County Trial Court before Judge Archie Brown.
