<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Martin, a 44-year-old resident of Belding, Michigan in Ionia County, has entered a guilty plea in a recent meth case. Police in Ionia County say he was </span><b>cooking methamphetamines in his garage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fact that the meth lab was located near other buildings in a populated area potentially putting others at risk, makes the crime an even more serious one.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The meth lab was discovered on May 22nd when officers from the Belding Police Department discovered Martin cooking meth in his garage. He was using the "</span><b>one pot method</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">," which is also sometimes called the "shake and bake" method. It entails putting all of the meth-making ingredients inside one container and allowing them to "cook off" in a contained environment. This method is very volatile and comes with a high risk of explosions.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>The matter had to be turned over to the bomb squad</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the hazardous nature of meth labs and how toxic the fumes are, the Central Michigan Enforcement Team (CMET) </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was contacted to deal with the problem. But once they arrived and saw what Martin had done with the chemicals, the matter had to be turned over to the bomb squad at Michigan State Police. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin is said to have placed the ingredients inside an empty metal oxygen cylinder, which he then capped, in an attempt to hide the drugs from police. However, according to the responding officers, the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chemicals inside the sealed cylinder were still actively producing gas which could easily have resulted in an explosion. For this reason, </span><b>the Michigan State Police Bomb Squad was called in to deal with the issue.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Martin appeared before Ionia County Circuit Court Judge Suzanne Kreeger at his plea hearing, she pointed out to him that his prior criminal history, along with the fact that his meth lab was located so closely to other structures, mean that he is looking at a </span><b>substantial period of time in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She also noted that she would not sentence him any lower than the middle of the state's sentencing advisory guidelines for this crime.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin is currently being held in the Ionia County Jail. He pleaded guilty to single counts of Operating a Methamphetamine Lab Near a Specified Area, and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery/Manufacture of Marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have no scheduled date for his sentencing, but the judge expects that it will be in the next few months.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police say this method of cooking meth is becoming more and more common of late.  </span><b>A meth cook using “one-pot” synthesis can create meth in less than an hour in their backyard, in a backpack, or even in a car while driving around</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But while the ‘one-pot’ method may be faster and easier, it is no less dangerous, and can easily result in fires, explosions, toxic exposure and even death.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the toxicity of methamphetamine production, and the risk it poses to other people and buildings in the area, producing it is considered to be a very dangerous and serious crime.
