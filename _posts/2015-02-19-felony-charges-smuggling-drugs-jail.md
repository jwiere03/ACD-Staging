Ask any medical student in the middle of their residency about the strange things people insert into their various orifices, and you will be able to settle in for at least an hour's worth of horrifying stories about hairbrushes, light bulbs, and flashlights. But as it turns out, medical students aren't the only ones who have first-hand knowledge of this rather uncomfortable subject - sheriff's deputies get their fair share as well. The only difference is, a doctor isn't likely to request felony charges for smuggling drugs into the jail after removing a crack pipe from your unmentionables, whereas the sheriff most certainly will.<!--more-->
<h2>26 Year Old Faces More Charges For HidingÂ Paraphernalia in Rectum</h2>
And this was unfortunately the case for 26-year-old Johny Nunn, who was recently arrested for allegedly stealing items from Walmart. Nunn, it seems, has a history of this particular offense. He has been charged with stealing from this particular store on two prior occasions already, and as a result, had been barred from the store. Unfortunately for him, choosing to return there makes this also a case of criminal trespassing in addition to theft.

The Clarksville Police Officer who responded to the scene says that Nunn had a number of stolen items stuffed into his pants and in his pockets when he left the store. Nunn was arrested and then transported to the Montgomery County Jail.

But while on route, the officer asked him whether or not he had any contraband items on, or "in", his person, listing drugs, weapons, or paraphernalia as examples. He apparently told Nunn that if he did have something he shouldn't, to "...give them to me now before taking it into jail and getting a felony charge.". Nunn claimed that he had nothing with him that could get him into trouble.

That, however, wasn't the case. A search at the jail conducted by the deputies turned up a burned glass pipe, which still contained some drug residue, which had been hidden inside Nunn's rectum. Unfortunately for Nunn, this means he will now face an additional felony charge of possession of contraband in a penal institution.

Although this particular incident didn't take place in Michigan, it is certainly something that happens often here in the mitten state, and is taken just as seriously. Smuggling drugs into a jail or prison here in Michigan, either for your own use or for the use of another prisoner, will result in felony charges that could net you many more years behind bars.
