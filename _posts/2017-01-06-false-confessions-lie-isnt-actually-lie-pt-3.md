<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for joining us for the third installment in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-confessions-lie-isnt-actually-lie-part-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on false confessions, and the Reid technique of interrogation. Today we want to break down </span><b>the controversial Reid technique, which law enforcement agencies all over Michigan and the US use for interviewing and interrogating suspects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during criminal investigations. It is a technique that </span><a href="https://reid.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John E. Reid &amp; Associates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims is flawless if used properly, but many others disagree. Let's take a look.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reid technique uses a three step process which starts with fact analysis, then introduces behavior analysis, and finally uses the Reid Nine Steps of interrogation. This is where it gets contentious. </span><b>During the behavior analysis, the interrogator conducts a non-accusatory interview which is designed simply to establish a "baseline" for the suspect's behavior </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">when they do not believe that they are under pressure. The Reid Nine Steps of Interrogation is where the accusations begin.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Reid technique, the investigator tells the suspect that all of the results of the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clearly point back to them (the suspect) as the one who committed the crime. </span><b>The investigator lays it out as if they were telling a story about an event that they already know most, if not all, of the details about.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is shared in a conversational tone, as if the fact that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the suspect's guilt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not in question, but rather is already a known fact.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The interrogator maintains a respectful and conversational tone throughout. They present an understanding and patient demeanor so that the suspect feels more relaxed about telling the truth. The interrogator also provides a variety of suggested justifications for the suspect's </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">behavior, saying things like, </span><b>"So, did you have this in mind when you purchased the gun, or was it more of an impulse situation?"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The implication here is that regardless of which option the suspect chooses, they are still admitting guilt.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who would like to know, the Reid Nine Steps of Interrogation look like this:</span></h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Direct confrontation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: telling the suspect that the evidence points to them. Offer them a chance to explain themselves.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Shift the blame</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: point out reasons, circumstances and individuals who could have led the accused to commit the crime, thereby making it "not their fault." </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keep denials to a minimum</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: don't give the suspect a chance to deny the accusation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Use suspect's explanation to support your point</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: when the suspect explains why they couldn't have done what they're accused of, use this as a form of cknowledgement.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Be sincere</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: this will ensure that the suspect is receptive to you.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Supply alternatives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: by now the suspect is arguing less, shift the discussion towards alternatives. If the suspect cries, point out that it implies guilt.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ask the 'alternative question'</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: provide two choices for what happened, with one being more socially acceptable than the other, which allows the suspect a chance to look "less guilty."</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Repetition of confession</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: get the suspect to repeat their confession in front of witnesses.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Document the confession</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ensure that you have a documented copy of the suspect's confession, whether audio, visual or written.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people all over the world, including here in Michigan, believe that the Reid technique is an unacceptable method of interviewing suspects. The reason for this is that </span><b>there have been countless instances where people have made false confessions to crimes, because they were bullied or coerced during the interrogation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In these cases, falsely accused suspects have been treated aggressively, frightened, threatened, and lied to about how much </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/private-investigators.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">supports the claim against them. It is important to remember that a suspect that is being interrogated by a trained and experienced police officer, is no match for the officer. It’s never a level playing field. That’s why the criminal defense attorneys at The Kronzek Firm always give the same advice: no discussions with police until your attorney is present. </span>
