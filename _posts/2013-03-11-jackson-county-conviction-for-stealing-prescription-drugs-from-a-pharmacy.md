Commonly in Michigan, people are prosecuted for various forms of prescription fraud. This usually happens when someone forges a prescription form and obtains prescription medications unlawfully. There are even large conspiracies where the group leader has access to a doctor’s DEA number or an illegally obtained pad of prescription forms. The leader typically uses numerous runners and sends them to fill the “scripts” at various pharmacies.
<h2> Jackson County Case Takes a Different Approach To Prescription Fraud</h2>
The jury in this Jackson County court case convicted a man named Brian Kane on multiple counts stemming from a robbery of a pharmacy in Blackman Township. Kane was convicted on charges of burglary, breaking and entering, and several drug possession charges. At sentencing Kane could receive 20 years or more in prison for his drug convictions.

Prosecutors had charged Kane with having nearly 500 grams of the drug oxycodone as well as several other prescription drugs, including smaller quantities of morphine and prescription pain relievers. However, none of the drugs have been found by police. The amounts and types were based upon what pharmacists reported missing after the robbery. Prosecutors tied Kane to the theft using DNA evidence from blood found at the scene. The blood was reportedly found on the handle of a drug cabinet in the pharmacy that was broken into.

At the time of the conviction Kane was already in prison for other break-ins in Washtenaw and Calhoun counties, facing up to ten years in prison for those crimes. Kane has now been convicted of over 20 different felony charges, including drug use charges. He will be sentenced in April.

Regardless of the tactics used, every drug case is serious and requires the services of a qualified Michigan Drug attorney to handle the case.
