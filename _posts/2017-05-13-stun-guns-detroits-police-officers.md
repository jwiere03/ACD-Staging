&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Detroit Board of Police Commissioners has been haggling over this issue for years. </span><b>Should Detroit police officers be allowed to use stun guns, also sometimes called tasers, or not?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, it seems the debate has reached a conclusion. Last week the Commission voted unanimously to allow Detroit Police officers to carry "electronic control weapons" while on duty.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are already several law enforcement departments in Michigan that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arm their officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Tasers, in particular the Michigan State Police. Many departments believe that </span><b>stun guns and Tasers offer law enforcement personnel in the field a non-lethal way to protect themselves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others. Being able to incapacitate someone who is a threat to officers and civilians without killing them is highly beneficial. At least, that's the argument used by police. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However not everyone agrees with this perspective. Some people believe that when using a non-lethal weapon, </span><b>some officers may be tempted to use additional force</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are recorded instances of officers repeatedly tasing someone, in some cases causing permanent injuries. According to </span><a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amnesty International</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since 2001 more than 500 people in the U.S. have become disabled after being exposed to a Taser or other ECD. All of this raises the issue of possible abuse.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit police Commissioner Reggie Crawford was one of the people who opposed the use of tasers by police in the beginning, but has since changed his mind. Crawford is a former Detroit police officer and a current </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayne County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sheriff’s deputy assigned to the county jail. He says he understands people's concerns because </span><b>he was initially very opposed to officers being armed with tasers and stun guns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Twelve years ago I was opposed to them, because I’d been reading about the deaths associated with them. However, this time around, I supported them, due to the fact that when you do the research, you’ll find </span><b>most of the deaths associated with the use of Tasers is because officers violated policy.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If they follow policy, there shouldn’t be too many issues."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically, </span><b>there are differences between stun guns and Tasers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although many people use the terms interchangeably. According to </span><a href="http://www.stun-gun-defense-products.com/buy-stun-gun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stun Gun Defense Products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, "Stun guns are close proximity self defense devices that use high-voltage electricity to stop an attacker by momentarily disabling muscle control." This is different from Tasers, which they describe as follows.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"TASER devices are electroshock weapons that use electrical current to disrupt muscle control, stopping an attacker dead in their tracks. </span><b>TASER devices can be used both close and far range.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upon firing, TASER devices shoot two metal probe darts a distance of 15 feet to reach an attacker before he reaches you. The TASER can also be used as a direct contact stun gun, allowing for close proximity self defense."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2012, Michigan law allows civilians to own stug guns and Tasers. However, the law treats these weapons much as they do guns. In order to purchase one you will need to </span><b>apply for a concealed carry permit and pass a training course</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Restrictions that govern their use, and penalties for misuse are very similar to those governing guns in the state of Michigan.</span>
