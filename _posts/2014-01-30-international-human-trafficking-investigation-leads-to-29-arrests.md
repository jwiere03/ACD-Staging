<h2><strong>29 Arrested (so far) in International Webcam-Child Abuse Trafficking Ring</strong></h2>
After a routine visit to a registered sex offender’s home in England, law enforcement uncovered evidence of an international organized crime ring based in the Philippines.  This crime ring involved individuals from 12 countries and specialized in live streaming of child sexual abuse.  It has been shut down following a joint investigation by international agencies including the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

British sex offender Timothy Ford had a number of child pornographic videos on computers at his home. The U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA) analyzed the information, identifying additional suspects and children.  International agencies were contacted and an investigation spanning the globe began.  “Operation Endeavour”, has resulted in the arrest of 29 individuals since 2012.

Child sex trafficking is a growing problem all over the world.  Some of the children involved in these live streamed videos were being exploited by family members for financial gain.  The increasing availability of hi-speed internet in developing countries makes it easier to connect with high-paying customers in other nations, including the United States.

Law enforcement officials all over the world are firm in their resolve to end child sex abuse and exploitation.  Michigan is no different.  The Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force works with local law enforcement agencies throughout the state, around the country and the world to investigate and prosecute individuals accused of child sex trafficking, child pornography and human trafficking.

If you are contacted by ICAC, ICE or any Michigan law enforcement agency in regards to child pornography, sex trafficking, or other forms of human trafficking  you need to know two things:  1. These crimes carry very heavy prison sentences, and 2. that there is help available from skilled trial attorneys.  The trial lawyers at The Kronzek Firm PLC, have extensive experience defending clients faced with child pornography and trafficking charges.
