&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new law, signed recently by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, addresses the need for law enforcement to </span><b>quickly and accurately identify people with special needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The idea that drove these bills is that in the event of a missing persons case, where the missing individual has special needs, police can identify them quickly and be properly prepared for all situations.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The law began as two bills, one sponsored by the House and the other by the Senate. The bill introduced by the House expands on the </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(mi0t4545zzd3de45kuqs4myo))/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-Act-176-of-1985.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child Identification and Protection Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by giving caregivers of special needs persons the </span><b>right to distribute that individual's personal information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the event that they go missing. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second portion of the legislation, sponsored by the Senate, expands on what is classified as identifying information, by allowing </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photographs and fingerprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be included in the information distributed. </span><b>Both bills passed the House and Senate unanimously</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before being signed into law by our governor. A clear sign that Michigan is one hundred percent behind this idea.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure what this means? Let's break it down….</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new law, the </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/msp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are required to provide a form on their website that can be downloaded and filled out by the parents or guardians of special needs persons. </span><b>This would then be submitted, along with the fingerprints and a photograph of the individual</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The information provided to the Michigan State Police would then be passed along to the the FBI. The reason? Because sometimes people with special needs go missing and, for their own safety, need to be located quickly and efficiently. That would include special needs people that might have crossed state lines. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Ensuring that all Michiganders can be </span><b>identified quickly in an emergency situation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is critically important. This legislation helps parents or guardians of individuals with special needs have greater peace of mind knowing that their loved one can be identified, should an unforeseen emergency occur." explained Governor Snyder at a recent press conference.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are not as pleased about the new database as its originators. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous citizens around Michigan have spoken up, claiming that this is nothing more than </span><b>another way for the government to collect data on innocent civilians and track them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although the legislation states that a parent or guardian has the right to request that the MSP </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remove that data from the FBI's files</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at any point in the future, not everyone believes it will be that easy. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Brandy Thompson at The Kronzek Firm thinks that “This looks like we need to balance the possible benefits of rescuing a person with special needs against the rights of that person to privacy. Whatever your position, it’s now our  law in Michigan. If it helps save a live, I’m all for for it.” </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As defense attorneys, we’re all about protecting the Constitutional right to privacy. We’re also all about saving lives. We understand how constantly changing legislation affects so many people's lives. For this reason, we work hard to keep our readers up to date with the newest and most relevant information. </span>
