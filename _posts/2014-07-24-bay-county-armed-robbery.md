<h2><b>Saginaw Teen Gets 20 Years </b></h2>
The second of four young men charged with armed robbery and assault, following a mini <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bay-city-crime-spree.html">crime spree in Bay City</a>, has been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for his part in the criminal exploits.

On Monday, July 21st, Bay County Chief Circuit Judge Kenneth W. Schmidt sentenced Nashawn D. Lane to prison for 126 months to 20 years. He was, however, given credit for 185 days already served in jail.<!--more-->

The incident that led to the charges occurred on January 14th, when 18-year-old Lane and three of his friends - Quay'von R. Brown, 18, Antonio D. Griffin, 19 and Sammie L. Wright III, 20, broke into an apartment in Bay City.

According to a woman who was in the apartment at the time of the break-in, 4 masked men with guns forced their way into the apartment, which belonged to a man named Rufus Smith. The men allegedly demanded money and drugs. According to the woman's testimony, one of the men, whom she identified as Brown, took her into the bathroom and sexually assaulted her.

All four men accepted plea deals, and pled no contest to armed robbery charges in exchange for the prosecution agreeing to drop all other charges. Brown, however, was faced with an additional charge of sexual assault for his role in the rape that took place at the apartment.

Just before the sentence was handed down, Lane made a statement to the judge, stating that he was sorry for his actions and had sought God's forgiveness. "Your Honor, I'd just like to apologize first off to my family and the victim and his family. I was young and dumb. I was a follower and not a leader in this. I do plan on bettering myself through the prison time I'm gonna receive. I gave up that lifestyle and I'm on a more righteous path, the path of the Lord."

Earlier this month, Brown was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 12 to 20 years, and 10 to 15 years. The last two members to face sentencing in this group of men will be Griffin and Wright, both of whom are scheduled for sentencing on August 11th.
