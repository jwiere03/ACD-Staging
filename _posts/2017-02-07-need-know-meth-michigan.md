<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Methamphetamine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also known by numerous other pseudonyms such as meth, ice, crank, glass, geeter, trash, and christina, is a concentrated, crystallized form of illegally manufactured methamphetamine. </span><b>It is a highly addictive and very dangerous drug</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you live in Michigan then there are some important facts that you need to know about meth.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Is meth a problem in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a word - yes! Meth use has </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-the-nations-new-meth-capital.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased significantly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the last few years here in Michigan. There are more and more instances of </span><b>discarded 'one-pot' meth labs being discovered abandoned</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in rural and wooded area around our state. Due to the hazardous and chemically unstable nature of meth labs, the expense involved in cleaning up 'meth dump sites' is quite high. The expensive and dangerous cleanups require specially trained members of a haz mat team. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What does meth look like?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation For a Drug-Free World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, methamphetamine usually comes in the form of "a </span><b>crystalline white powder that is odorless, bitter-tasting and dissolves easily in water</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or alcohol." It is usually white, however, other colors have been noted, including brown, yellow-gray, orange and even pink. The powder is sometimes compressed into a pill form to be taken orally. 'Crystal meth' usually comes in the form of clear chunky crystals that resemble ice.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How is meth made?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meth is 'cooked' using one of two methods. Either in small quantities </span><b>using the one-pot or 'shake-and-bake' method, which is far more common</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or produced in much larger quantities in a fixed lab. Large lab set ups, like the one seen in the ever popular </span><a href="http://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking Bad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are actually very rare. Most people in Michigan who produce methamphetamine do so using the one-pot method, since it is convenient, cheap, and has the benefit of being mobile.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Is meth dangerous?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, for sure. For two reasons. First, the methods used in the production of meth are highly toxic. The fumes produced as a byproduct are highly flammable and </span><b>numerous meth cooks have died or been severely injured when their labs exploded</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://abuseandneglectdefense.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorney/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children living in meth houses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> often suffer medical side-effects, and neighbors have lost their homes to the resulting fire. Secondly, because meth is highly addictive.  </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Is meth illegal in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. The </span><b>possession, use, production and sale of meth are all illegal in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under Michigan law, methamphetamine use is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in jail and possible fine of up to $2,000. Meth possession is a felony. The sentence for possession is more severe. You could go to prison for up to 10 years, pay a fine of up to $15,000, or both. The manufacture and delivery of meth are also felonies, but these are considered to be much more serious, and are punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Federal law also imposes harsh prison terms for making meth. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Can CPS take my kids because of meth?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are caught making meth with children in your home, or meth components are present on your property, you should expect that Children’s Protective Services of Michigan (CPS) will become extensively involved in your life. </span><b>CPS considers meth use and production to be abusive and neglectful to children. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are being investigated by both CPS and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you are going to need a Michigan attorney who regularly practices CPS defense as well as Michigan drug defense. These are two separate areas of the law and each has its own expertise. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Will I need an attorney for meth charges?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely! Whether you are facing criminal charges for drugs, or CPS has petitioned the court to remove your children, you are going to need a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">skilled defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with years of experience handling each. </span><b>At The Kronzek Firm, our attorneys have spent decades helping the people of Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accused of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use, possession and delivery, and also those who have been targeted by CPS.
