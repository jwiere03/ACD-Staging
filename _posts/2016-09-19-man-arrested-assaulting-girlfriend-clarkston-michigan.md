<span style="font-weight: 400;">A 31-year-old man from Clarkston in Oakland County, MI has been arrested for assaulting his girlfriend and smashing the windshield of her car. Police say that the domestic violence happened as a result of </span><b>an argument between the pair, because she wouldn't lend him  her car</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomfield Township Police, officers were called to the scene of a domestic disturbance at 2:30 am, by a woman who had been </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beaten up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by her boyfriend. When officers arrived, the woman explained that Andy Fugate had tried to take her car. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">She told officers that </span><b>she hadn't wanted him to drive because she was concerned that he had had too much to drink</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and may get into an </span><a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident-in-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it appears that Fugate didn't agree with his girlfriend's assessment of his sobriety.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When she refused, he </span><b>forcibly took the keys from her</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assaulted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her, and then</span><b> jumped up and down on the car's windshield to break it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, before finally driving away in the vehicle. According to the police report, Fugate "punched, and jumped on the windshield until it was completely shattered."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers began searching for Fugate, and found him not long afterwards on Woodward Avenue. He was driving the car he had taken from his girlfriend, but was </span><b>only travelling about 30 miles per hour</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and was </span><a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/michigan-drunk-driving-misdemeanors.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to stay in his designated lane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An officer pulled him over and arrested him.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith was </span><b>transported to the Oakland County Jail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where he remains after being granted a $100,000 bond by Judge Diane D’Agostini. He appeared before Judge D'Agostini in the 48th District Court recently, where he was arraigned on numerous charges. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These include </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestic Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malicious Destruction of Property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating while Intoxicated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Driving on a Suspended License. </span><b>Fugate entered a plea of 'Not Guilty' to all of the charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and was scheduled to reappear in court for his next hearing on September 21, 2016.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who may be unclear on the difference between Assault and Domestic Assault, we will break it down simply for you. Domestic violence, or Domestic Assault happens when a person assaults or batters any person who in a domestic relationship with them. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that </span><b>the only difference between a standard assault charge and a domestic assault charge is the victim's relationship to the batterer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it is important to remember that the victim need not be injured for the prosecutors to bring a domestic assault charge. That will often make this a 'he said, she said' situation.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being falsely accused of domestic assault is a terrible experience It </span><b>is often a case of nothing more than the word of the alleged victim against yours</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and cops sometimes jump to quick conclusions about who to arrest and charge. </span>
