There has long been held the belief that antidepressants, engineered to help people feel better, can be directly linked to violence and aggressive behaviors. A number of studies over the years even backed this up. A study conducted in 2010 by the <a href="http://www.ismp.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Safe Medication Practices</a> found that five commonly used antidepressants were linked in disproportionately large ways to reports of violence and aggressive behaviors. Antidepressants began to be linked to violent episodes like school shootings, unprovoked assaults and even murder.<!--more-->
<h2>Distrust of Medications and Those Taking Them</h2>
Although the link between medicine and violence was a highly controversial one, many people, both in the public and in the medical community, supported these beliefs. Among the most notable culprits were Prozac, Paxil, Luvox and Effexor. Between the widely held belief that antidepressants also increased the risk of suicide, and now the fact that they increase violent behaviors, fewer and fewer people trusted their medication. Or their medicated friends and family members.

A recent study conducted in Finland proves that the link between antidepressants and violence is far less of an issue that previously believed. For people taking Prozac and Paxil, this will be welcome news indeed. But as it turns out, there is a link between medications and murder, it's just not antidepressants.

Painkillers. Prescription painkillers like Oxycontin and Vicodin, and prescription sedatives like Valium, Xanax and Ativan, have all now been linked to increased chances for homicide. But why? What is it about these particular medications that increases a person's risk for violent behaviors?

Well, there are a number of factors involved here, and one critical thing to remember is this: medicine is not a magic switch in your brain. According to Dr. Alan Manevitz, a clinical psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital who reviewed the findings in this recent Finnish study, no medication is going to make an average, non-violent person into a homicidal maniac. So don't worry about that.

But the study results did show an increased risk of violent behaviors, as much as 45%.  For people under 26 years of age, the risk was doubled. But an important thing to remember here, as Dr. Manevitz pointed out, is that these drugs have a disinhibiting effect on the human brain. What this means is, for people who were already prone to violent impulses and tendencies, the inhibitions keeping them from acting on the impulses were greatly reduced by the medication.

And the study is quick to point out that, while the link between pain killer medications and murder seems significant, it shouldn't keep doctors from prescribing them to patients in need. What it does mean, however, is that the subject deserves further study. And also that perhaps doctors should pay closer attention to those patients in need of pain killers.

So for those of you who take antidepressants, rest assured that your medications aren't likely to land you in jail for murder. But whatever the reason, if the police are involved in your life and you need excellent representation, call us. 866-7NO JAIL. We can help.
