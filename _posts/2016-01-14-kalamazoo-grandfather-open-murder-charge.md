<h2><b>Grandfather Charged with Open Murder in Death of Grandson</b></h2>
At a recent court hearing, it was explained to the Judge that Bruce Embry had shot his grandson in the head. He had even admitted it to the police who arrived on the scene, after someone called in a domestic disturbance concern in Kalamazoo just days ago.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just after 2:30 in the afternoon when officers arrived at the house on Lane Boulevard, and found 17-year-old Temetrion Hegler inside, lying on the floor with a gunshot wound in his head. Embry was there too, unarmed, but he immediately told the officers that he had been the one to pull the trigger. "I shot him," he said to the officers, his voice clear and steady, "Take me to jail."</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hegler was found to be unarmed, and though emergency responders called an ambulance, it was determined that Hegler was dead at the scene. A 25 caliber handgun was discovered in one of the bedrooms at the scene.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At his recent arraignment, Embry appeared before Kalamazoo County District Judge Christopher T. Haenicke via video feed from the Kalamazoo County Jail. He was charged with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html" target="_blank">open murder</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">committing a felony while in possession of a firearm</a>, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He was quiet and polite during his arraignment, and other than one word answers in response to questions asked by the Judge, he spoke only when given leave to do so. At one point he explained that it had been accidental. "I did not mean to shoot that young man." </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the hearing Embry was granted a court appointed attorney, but was denied bail. It was also revealed that he does have a prior criminal record, including a larceny conviction. He is also a registered sex offender since May of 1998, when he was convicted of fourth degree CSC.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview given to the media by Embry's wife, Iquilia Hegler, she shared that Embry had told her that day that Temetrion was home from school that day, and hadn't gone to class. Temetrion had later told her that he had overheard his grandfather on the phone with a woman. Shortly thereafter, Embry took out the gun and shot Temetrion in the head.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Open murder means that the prosecutor has determined that the jury will be asked to choose whether the defendant is charged with first or second degree murder. Under Michigan law, first degree murder is punishable by mandatory life in prison, with no possibility of parole. Second degree murder is punishable by any number of years, up to life in prison.</span>
