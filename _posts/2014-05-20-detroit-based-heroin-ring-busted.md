<h2>Final Arrest Made in Inter-state Heroin Trafficking Operation</h2>
The final person said to be involved in an inter-state heroin trafficking ring based out of Detroit, has been arrested and is in custody. Kevin Perino Foy Jr., of Detroit, MI was arrested last week in Michigan on warrants out of Kentucky.

In the first half of last year, Rowan County Sheriff's Department in Kentucky were alerted to a large and intricately planned drug operation. It was bringing substantial quantities of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank">heroin</a> into Morehead, Kentucky via the Greyhound Bus system. Investigators were able to trace the heroin back to Detroit, Michigan.

Police say that the operation was very carefully planned and executed. Traffickers used established aliases, motels and hotels, and a network of private residents in the county who were paid for the use of their homes and vehicles. According to police reports, traffickers often paid rent and utility bills and even purchased groceries for the persons whose houses were used as cover.

Investigators said that the Greyhound Bus system has become very widely used by drug suppliers, and has resulted in a drug trafficking triangle that stretches from Michigan down into Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia.

While several of the people affiliated with the heroin smuggling were from outside of Michigan, a few were Michigan-based locals: Levaries D. McCain, also known as Mike, 19, of Farmington Hills, MI; Theoplius M. Tipton, also known as Tracy, 18, of Detroit, MI; and Christopher Dixon of East Pointe, MI. They were all arrested some months ago and are facing various sentences for their involvement.

Dewan Deante Goode, also known as Dre, a 20-year-old from Detroit, was earmarked as the organizer and leader of the drug trafficking ring. He was arrested when he decided to handle his own sales, after a few of his suppliers were arrested. Goode was caught by undercover agents in Ashland, Kentucky. The agents purchased 10 grams of heroin and then, when the sale was complete, arrested him.

Foy has been charged with engaging in organized crime, which is a felony. According to federal law, engaging in a criminal organization involved in drug trafficking is an very serious crime, punishable by no less than 20 years in prison, with the possibility of up to life. Also, the accused may be required to pay a fine of up to $2,000,000.
