<span style="font-weight: 400;">Armond Christopher Degasperis, an 18-year-old Blackman Township resident, is accused of pointing a stolen airsoft rifle at a number of customers in a Meijer store while intoxicated.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to records released by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackman-Leoni Township public safety department, officers were sent to the scene of a disorderly persons / shoplifting report. The incident took place at about 1 am inside the Meijer store on Airport road on November 6th.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Witness testimony was that Degasperis was inside the store, when he opened a brand new air rifle and removed it from the packaging. He then proceeded to walk out of the store with the gun, without stopping to pay for it. On his way out, he is said to have pointed it at several other customers.</span>

<h2>The attempted carjacking wasnâ€™t successful</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once outside the store, Degasperis allegedly pointed the gun at a man sitting in his car, in an attempt to steal the vehicle. However the attempted carjacking wasn't successful, as the victim was able to drive away when Degasperis became distracted. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after, the intoxicated 18-year-old returned to the store and tried to take a hunting knife from the sporting goods aisle in the same manner. However this time, the police were there and waiting for him.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He was arrested and transported to the Jackson County Jail, and is now facing two charges. Degasperis has been charged with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">two counts of third degree retail fraud, and a single count of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">assault with a dangerous weapon</a>. Under Michigan law, assault with a dangerous weapon is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison. Third degree retail fraud is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days or a fine of up to $500.00 or three times the value of the stolen property.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Degasperis is scheduled to appear before District Judge R. Darryl Mazur for his preliminary examination on November 19th.</span>
