&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug use is rising, both in Michigan and all over the United State. This is common knowledge. So if the '</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">war on drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">' has been declared a failure and </span><b>substance abuse is actually worse now than it was when the government first decided to crack down on the use and abuse of illicit substances</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what can we do about? Is there a viable solution, and can it be implemented in a way that effectively saves lives without costing the state and the nation, a fortune?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Rick Snyder seems to think so. Snyder recently revealed a </span><b>bipartisan package of bills that aims to reduce opportunities for developing addiction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thereby nipping the problem in the bud. So what preventative measures do they hope to implement, and how do they plan to make the necessary changes? It'll work like this...</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Michigan Automated Prescription System (MAPS) is an online database that tracks prescription drugs, who they were issued to and which doctor wrote the prescription</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It aims to provide prescribers with an easy to use portal to a database of statewide </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prescription information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That way, they can easily obtain information about controlled substances and Schedule 2-5 drugs that a patient may have previously had prescribed, and make informed decisions about future prescriptions. In short, our MAPS system allows pharmacists, doctors, hospitals, clinics, nurse practitioners and physician assistants to see your prescription history. It also allows the government access to that same information.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2>MAPS will make tracking prescriptions for opioids in Michigan so much easier for doctors.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent press release, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said that Michigan will be taking an active role in saving lives and providing second chances to Michiganders by "working to prevent overdose deaths. While we've made some progress, </span><b>people are still becoming addicted and tragically dying from overdoses, so our work is far from over</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This new strategy focuses on primary prevention in hopes that we can reduce </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opioid misuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prevent addiction from occurring in the first place."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of issue that the legislation hopes to address, but some of the more prominent ones are to do with </span><b>tracking prescriptions, educating the public, and penalizing 'over-prescribing' physicians</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, the new legislation will:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require prescribers to obtain reports from MAPS before prescribing or dispensing Schedule 2 through 5 controlled substances to a patient </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require disciplinary action if a prescriber is not obtaining reports from MAPS</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase penalties for physicians and pharmacists who wrongfully prescribe, dispense, manufacture or distribute controlled substances</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require prescribers to have a bona-fide physician-patient relationship with a patient before prescribing a Schedule 2 through 5 controlled substance </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require schools to include education on opioids and the potential for addiction in health education curriculum</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
