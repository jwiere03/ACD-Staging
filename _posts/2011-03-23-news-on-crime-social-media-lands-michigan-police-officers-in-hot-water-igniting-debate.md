  As social media and the Internet
  continue to integrate into everyday

  increasingly questionable--particularly

One does not need to be a top criminal lawyer to know the affects that increases in technology have had on society. Quicker and easier than ever before, people from all over the world can share information (including news stories, pictures, and videos) with others. Although the advances in technology have made life easier in some respects, lawmakers in Michigan and across the country are still learning how to handle legal issues involving the Internet and, more specifically, popular social media sites.

Most of the people who surf these websites do so for social interaction with others around the world. Although most users will not get into trouble for what they post online, this is not true for everyone. Many people in influential occupations, such as teachers or sports coaches, have been slapped with tough penalties because of what they post online. Educators and athletic coaches across the country have either been suspended or fired due to rude or antagonistic comments made about students or parents on social media websites.


<h2>Detroit Police Officers may not be held to the same standards</h2>

While it seems that everyone is taking a tough stance on what is posted online, some are getting off easier than others. While teachers and coaches have been fired over information shared online, a recent notice to Detroit Police Officers shows that law enforcement may not be held to the same standards.

Recently, a Detroit police officer was placed on desk duty after he posted pictures of a 54 year-old man embroiled in a stand-off with other officers. The law enforcement official posted these video images online, and eventually they ended up on Facebook. In response, Cmdr Jeffery Romeo and Deputy Chief Janice Butler issued a notice to officers stating: "When using social media, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc., department members shall be mindful that their... postings become part of the worldwide electronic domain."

Even though this notice encourages officers to be mindful of the information that they post on the Internet, it seems highly unfair when one considers the consequences that others (such as teachers) have faced for the same offenses. Why wouldn't law enforcement officials be held accountable for posting images online that were taken in the line of duty? Is capturing images or photos during this time even legal? Could posting information on a social network hinder a criminal investigation? Or, could these actions be considered tampering with evidence? And what about libel laws? How do they apply here?

When considering questions like these, it is best to seek answers from <a title="Top Criminal Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">top criminal attorneys</a> who are well-versed in state and federal computer laws. Because varying occupations handle problems with social media differently, it is important to speak with a skilled defense attorney who can explain the potential outcomes of sharing information online. Being accused of a computer or Internet crime can change one's life permanently. Therefore, one must know how sharing information online may effect them in the long-run, whether it be in the work-place, at home, or within the legal system.
