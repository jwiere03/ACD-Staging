The virtual world has become very much a part of every day life. Increases in technology have made it easier for people to communicate with others around the world, allowing people to be connected like never before. While this has provided many benefits to society as a whole, it has also opened new doors for illegal activity. One does not have to be an experienced criminal lawyer in Michigan to know that illegal activity online can land anyone in serious trouble, regardless of profession or public status.
<h2>Well Known Public Figures Hiding Identities Online</h2>
Of all the online crimes, those involving the sexual exploitation of minors are considered particularly heinous--especially when involving well-known figures attempting to hide their identity behind the Internet. Such an example is seen in the recent arrest of a Lake Orion pastor who was busted by Federal investigators in an online chat sex sting.

Agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation started looking at William Bendert after receiving a tip that the pastor had attempted to entice a minor for sexual contact online. Detectives set up a sting operation, posing online as a mother with an 11 year-old daughter. The "mother" and Bendert chatted online, where he offered to provide "sexual training" for her daughter. According to police reports, the pastor said he would teach the girl various sexual positions and help her learn about her body. Additionally, Bendert allegedly requested that the mother also be present and "encourage" her daughter to participate.

After the conversations continued, the two agreed to meet at a Red Roof Inn in Troy and Bendert booked a room. However, when he arrived FBI officials immediately arrested him and took him into custody. The criminal complaints against him are considered Federal offenses, as they were conducted online.

Because of the Federal charges pending against him, Bendert will almost certainly face the toughest of punishments, likely including stiff fines and a lengthy jail sentence. Additionally, as pastors serve as public figures, it is also probable that his occupation and reputation will also suffer greatly as a result. For Bendert and others accused of Internet sex crimes, it is essential to pro-actively seek the best legal advice and legal representation for your case.
