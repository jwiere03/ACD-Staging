&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday he </span><a href="https://www.chpa.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Healthcare Products Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CHPA) made public the results of a consumer survey conducted here in Michigan. The results are very interesting. They reveal that a majority of registered </span><b>Michigan voters are opposed to legislation which would make over-the-counter cold medication containing pseudoephedrine available by prescription only</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pseudoephedrine is an important ingredient used in the criminal manufacture of Meth. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The research was conducted by Basswood Research via telephone, over the course of three days in mid-November. Carlos Gutiérrez, vice president for state and local government affairs at CHPA made a statement in which he called the possible legislation a "costly and overreaching approach." He also went on to point out that </span><b>Michigan already has a number of laws in place which are aimed at combating the state's meth problem.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is indeed true. </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Methamphetamines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or "meth" is widely recognized as highly addictive and very dangerous, is completely illegal in Michigan. Use, Possession, Sale and Manufacture of meth in Michigan are all crimes, with </span><b>use being the least serious and manufacture being the most serious</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Criminal punishment, however, is not the only thing that Michigan authorities have put in place to combat drug abuse. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/lara" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LARA), one of the methods by which law enforcement can track potential prescription drug abusers is through MAPS. </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-72600_72603_55478---,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Automated Prescription System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the </span><b>prescription monitoring program which helps to identify and prevent drug diversion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at multiple levels. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule 2 through 5 controlled substances prescriptions that are dispensed by pharmacies and practitioners are collected and logged in MAPS. From there, </span><b>physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, veterinarians and other medical professionals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are able to search for patient-specific reports and information. This data can be reviewed, allowing the practitioner to determine if patients are receiving </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controlled substances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from other providers.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meth can be "cooked," usually in small quantities, using </span><b>an array of ingredients available from the average grocery store or gas station in combination with cold medicine containing pseudoephedrine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For this reason, law enforcement and legislators were both highly in favor of any method that allowed restricted dispersal of pseudoephedrine. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while meth production is a rising problem here in Michigan, it appears that the majority of the meth sold and used here in Michigan is actually imported. "</span><b>According to a recent report from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, 99.8% of the meth in the United States comes from Mexico</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." Gutiérrez revealed in his statement. If that is indeed the case, then restricting people's access to needed  over the counter </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will not solve the problem.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey, </span><b>almost two thirds of Michiganders use medication to treat colds and allergies, with four out of every five using non-prescription medication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of the people polled, almost 70% of them were opposed to the idea of having to get a prescription in order to treat a cold or allergies with medication containing PSE.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug crimes are complex, and here in Michigan </span><b>the laws that determine sentences are different for different drugs, based on a wide array of factors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you or a loved one have been accused of any crime related to the use, sale, manufacture or trafficking of drugs you are going to need a highly skilled and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
