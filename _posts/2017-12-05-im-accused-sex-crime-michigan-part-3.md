&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for joining us for the last installment in this </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/26221.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three part series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on </span><b>what to do if you've been accused of a sex assault crime here in Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We've tried to break down the information into bite-sized chunks, so to speak. That way, you're better able to remember it when you need it. If you're only joining us now, we highly recommend that you go back and look over our previous blog articles in this series so that you don't miss any valuable information!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, </span><b>write down our number (866 766 5245) and put it in your cell phone right now! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, if you ever need a highly recommended attorney at a moment's notice, you'll be all over it. It's always better to be safe than sorry. So make sure that you have our number with you at all times. That way, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you need us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are only a phone call away. Our phones answer 24/7 and clients actually hire us at all hours of the day and night. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Post bond as soon as possible!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, you need to get out of jail as soon as possible. If the judge or magistrate has granted you bail, you need to post it as soon as you're able. If you have any </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bail-bonds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reduction issues, our skilled attorneys can help you by filing requests for reduction of bond on your behalf. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, </span><b>if you are arraigned and asked how you plead, you should state, "I stand mute." </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t been arraigned yet, then talk to your lawyer about what's best in your case. We're here to help you with that.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Never waive a preliminary examination without talking to your attorney!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A District Court preliminary examination, also called a "prelim," is required before a felony case can be bound over to Circuit Court. This proceeding is an important pre-trial proceeding where the judge determines </span><b>whether or not the prosecutor has proven probable cause in your case and whether it should proceed up to the circuit court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the biggest mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a client can make is to waive their prelim without consulting with their attorney first! Okay, we need to explain that. Our defense team feels that there is seldom any reason to waive a preliminary examination in district court. Having a lazy, underpaid or incompetent is not an excuse to waive a prelim. If you’re stuck relying on a court appointed lawyer, or if you’ve hired a cheap lawyer that wants to waive your right to a preliminary exam, watch out. There needs to be a very good reason for that waiver. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your criminal defense lawyer should make substantial progress on your case at a preliminary examination, so it is very important that this particular court appearance </span><b>should not be waived without a really good reason</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once it is waived, you cannot change your mind and the opportunity is generally gone forever.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Meet with your lawyer as soon as humanly possible.</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your attorney is on your side. So you MUST tell them everything. Don't be coy or ashamed about the details of your case. And besides, trying to hide information will only hurt your case. It's critical that you be </span><b>candid and forthcoming with all information </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">related to the events in question. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also be sure to </span><b>tell us about any prior criminal history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or witnesses that might either aid or damage your case. The most important point to remember is that </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/attorneys/charles-kronzek"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the best criminal defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starts with you.
