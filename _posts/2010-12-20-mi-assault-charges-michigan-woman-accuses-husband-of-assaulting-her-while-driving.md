While all marriages have their ups and downs, sometimes altercations between married couples turn violent. Any top criminal lawyer would warn however, that just because the domestic violence occurs between married people, it does not mean that a spouse will not face criminal charges for their actions. Such an example is seen in a recent case, where an East Lansing woman  reported her husband for domestic assault after he repeatedly struck her while she was driving them home.

In early November 2010, law enforcement officials in East Lansing received a phone call from a woman complaining of domestic assault problems with her husband. The woman had just gotten into an argument with her husband, Harvey Lee Hester, 28, concerning his drinking problem. His wife insisted that he not drive home while intoxicated. This angered Hester, who began to hit his wife while she was driving through the intersection of Grand River and Hagadorn in Ingham County.

<h2>Conviction for domestic assault can have serious consequences</h2>

His actions in the car prompted Hester’s wife to drive directly to the police station, where Hester was arrested on Michigan <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank">domestic assault charges</a>. However, problems in Hester’s marriage are likely the least of his worries – conviction for domestic assault can have serious consequences on a person’s life including jail time, probation, domestic violence classes and stiff fines. Additionally, it is possible to be eliminated from prospective jobs because of an assault charge on one’s record.

While it is no secret that every marriage has its problems, cases such as these prove that criminal charges are common when altercations become physically assaultive. Because of the significant punishments that can befall a person convicted of any assault charge in Michigan, it is essential to have an experienced and knowledgeable legal team on your side.
