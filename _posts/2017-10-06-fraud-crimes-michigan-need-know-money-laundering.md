<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thanks for hanging in there with us through this series on fraud crimes in Michigan. So far we've looked at a wide range of different state and federal fraud crimes, from </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-credit-card-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit card fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-tax-evasion.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax evasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-embezzlement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embezzlement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-health-care-fraud.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">health care fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this last installment in the series we're going to wrap up our fraud discussions with a look at money laundering.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is money laundering?</b></h2>
<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-money-laundering-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money laundering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is probably the most well known fraud crime, because it gets frequent mentions in movies. Court dramas and cop shows regularly feature the </span><b>stereotyped mafia boss</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is said to be involved in a long list of criminal activities, one of which always seems to be money laundering. But what does that mean?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It means this: when you launder money, you take money gained through criminal activities, and filtering it through a series of financial transactions that end up </span><b>making that money appear to be legal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is sometimes referred to as "washing" the cash (making it look clean again), hence the term laundering. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What counts as money laundering?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Money laundering can actually refer to several different methods for cleaning "dirty" money. For example, if someone makes money </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/prostitution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">running prostitutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they need to </span><b>disguise their profits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to not arouse suspicion from authorities. This could be done several ways  including but not limited to:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structuring, which is sometimes called smurfing, is where </span><b>cash is broken into smaller deposits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of money, made over time. This could also be done by using smaller amounts of cash to purchase money orders, and then depositing those, again in small amounts. One reason for this is that bank report transactions to the government involving more than $10,000 each.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulk cash smuggling, which involves physically </span><b>smuggling cash to another country</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and depositing it in a bank there (commonly called offshore accounts), where the laws are less rigorous money or the privacy protection laws are more lax. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disguising earnings as income from cash-intensive businesses. In this case, illegally obtained money would be </span><b>filtered through a legal business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that expects to receive most of its income in cash. This could include laundromats, tanning salons, pizza shops, car washes and strip clubs. The business then claims all cash received as legitimate earnings. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trade-based laundering, which involves </span><b>under or over-valuing invoices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to disguise the movement of money.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are the penalties for money laundering?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Money laundering in Michigan is vigorously prosecuted under both state and federal cirminal laws. The penalties differ in severity, based on the amount of money involved and the other criminal activity used to cover up the origins of the money. Under state of Michigan criminal laws:</span>

&nbsp;

<b>First-degree money laundering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a felony with a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, a fine up to $500,000.00, or twice the value of the proceeds, whichever is greater, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Second-degree money laundering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a felony with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine up to $100,000.00, or twice the value of the proceeds, whichever is greater, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Third-degree money laundering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a felony with a  maximum penalty of 5 years in prison, a fine up to $50,000.00, or twice the value of the proceeds, whichever is greater, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Fourth-degree money laundering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a high court misdemeanor with a penalty of up to 2 years imprisonment, a fine up to $10,000.00, or twice the value of the proceeds, whichever is greater, or both. Don’t be fooled by the phrase “high court misdemeanor.” In Michigan, this is treated as a felony despite that misleading label. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the fines and prison time, there is also the issue of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/new-civil-asset-forfeiture-law-signed-michigans-law.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">civil asset forfeiture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consider. Under Michigan law, </span><b>any real or personal property purchased with laundered money</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is subject to seizure and forfeiture. Although Michigan's civil asset forfeiture laws have been under review recently, and have changed for the better, we still have a long way to go.  </span>
