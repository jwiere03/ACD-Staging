<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again as we unravel this </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/legislation-allow-forced-drug-intervention-addicts-michigan.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complex subject</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and discuss what needs to change Â for addiction to become a thing of the past. </span><b>The reality is that drug addiction has become more and and more of a problem here in Michigan and all over the U.S. with each passing year.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The failed war on drugs has done nothing to stem the epidemic. Some have even argued that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalizing addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has actually made the problem worse. So what can be done?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first installment in this series, we looked at </span><b>a local Michigan couple who lost a daughter to </b><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><b>heroin</b></a><b>, and have since made it their goal to change state law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are hoping to introduce into </span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(eknzxvqipgpqk4di3z1n1dt4))/mileg.aspx?page=home" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a provision that would allow families and loved one to force people struggling with substance abuse into rehab, in the event that they won't seek help for themselves. Meghan's ARMY, as they call themselves, is in honor of Meghan Reid, who overdosed on October 30th, 2016.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Would it help, though? </span><b>Would it make a difference if parents, spouses, even adult children could force their loved ones into rehab when they refuse to go themselves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">? This is a tricky subject. Technically, while </span><a href="http://abuseandneglectdefense.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents have control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over their minor children, when the person in question is a legal adult, it's harder to force them to do anything and have the law on your side. A valid point, certainly, but Sergeant Doug Chapman disagrees.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The intention here, he said while addressing </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/shiawassee-county-criminal-defense-attorney-shiawassee-criminal-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiawassee County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">'s drug court, is </span><b>to allow loved ones to step in when a person's "judgement is clouded by drugs or mental illness.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" However, while that would address the issue of recovery here in Michigan, it doesn't answer the question of why the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug abuse epidemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become such a growing problem across the world. So what would?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, addiction is </span><b>brain illness, not a result of opioid use. So according to Dr. Frieden, until we change the way we look at addiction, we are never going to overcome it. What does that mean, though? What could we possible change in our mindset that would help us reduce and possibly even eliminate drug use? A lot, says </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Mark Calarco.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Calarco, the national medical director of American Addiction Centers, is a national leader in drug and alcohol abuse treatment. In an article published in the </span><a href="http://observer.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Dr. Calarco points out that while there are many factors that influence addiction, there are four main areas where a skewed perspective has a major impact on drug addiction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four areas Dr. Calarco names are:</span></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stigma, </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media </span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If we can get a handle on these four areas, Dr. Calarco believes, we will be able to address a substantial portion of our nation's </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-crime-sentencing.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug addiction problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>However, like so many things in life, knowing what needs to change is only a small fraction of the solution. Introducing actual lasting change, which is much harder, is where the real work lies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And yet it's where people struggle the most. After all, change is hard.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us next time, when we will be taking a closer look at the four 'skewed perspectives' that Dr. Calarco says need to change, and what we can do to change them. Until then, if you or a loved one need help for a drug related </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal charge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state of Michigan, or in the federal courts of Michigan,, including the use, sale, or manufacture of drugs, contact us immediately at 866-766-5245.
