&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Doug Chapman, a sergeant with the </span><a href="http://www.shiawassee.net/law-justice/sheriffs-office" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiawassee County Sheriff's Department</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and his long-time partner, Molly are the couple behind </span><b>a campaign to change state law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Specifically, the part of state legislation that deals with allowing family members and loved ones to intervene when someone is struggling with addiction.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Molly's daughter, who Chapman served as a father figure to for years, recently died of a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heroin overdose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meghan Reid, who is described as having come from a loving, close knit family, and having aspirations to become a nurse, instead developed a heroin addiction. </span><b>Although she made half-hearted attempts at getting clean, heroin's hold on her was just too strong</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She was found dead on October 30, 2016, of a heroin overdose.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an address he made to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.shiawassee.net/Law-Justice/District-Court/District-Court-Probation" target="_blank">Shiawassee County Drug Court,</a> which was covered by <a href="http://www.mlive.com" target="_blank">MLive</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sergeant Chapman explained that the loss of Meghan's life was a tragedy that should never have happened. He said that he discovered that her boyfriend was a heroin user, but </span><b>when he confronted her about it, she denied having anything to do with it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That denial carried over into the entire family.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sgt. Chapman, "</span><b>The entire family was in complete denial. No one thought this could happen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Meghan." But it didn't take long for Chapman to realize the truth. Meghan was spending more and more time in the bathroom. When Chapman searched the bathroom, he began to find used needles and other </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-crime-sentencing.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug paraphernalia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet when they tried to address the issue with Meghan, she claimed she had it under control.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Chapman feels very strongly that Meghan would still be here if he and Reid had been able to force her to participate in some kind of drug rehabilitation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "Everyone that I have spoken to that was addicted, they told me that if (treatment) wasn't forced upon them, they would have never been able to get away from it. I know this is going to be long, hard road, but if someone doesn't do something now, we are going to lose a lot of our loved ones."</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>The new legislation would allow family members to force addicts into rehab.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapman and Reid are hoping that they can raise awareness, and ultimately change Michigan law in this area. </span><b>Ultimately, they are pushing for legislation that will allow family members to force those who are struggling with addiction into treatment, even if they don't want to go</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "We have to be able, as loved ones, to do something!" Chapman insists. They have started a Facebook page called </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MeghansARMY/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meghan's ARMY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Addiction, Recovery, Movement 4 Youth), which they hope will raise awareness of the heroin epidemic.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an article published in the Observer, Dr. Mark Calarco raises the question whether</span><b> the reason we are struggling to overcome opioid addiction is because our perspective on the subject is incorrect.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Calarco, the national medical director of American Addiction Centers, is a leader in drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and a firm believer in the fact that in order to conquer this pandemic, we need to change the way we view it.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his article, he quotes Dr. Tom Frieden, director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who also wrote on the subject of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opioid addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year. "Although the opiate epidemic is fueled by a number of different elements, the underlying factor for most people is addiction, yet the term “opiate addiction” is a bit of a misnomer. </span><b>Addiction itself is a brain illness, not a result of opioid use, and until we shift our collective perception of the disease, we won’t make a dent in the opioid epidemic.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us next time, as we look at how our collective perspective on drug addiction has helped to fuel, rather than overcome, the epidemic we are currently facing. </span><b>Perhaps through education and awareness, we can finally make some strides toward conquering these deadly addictions once and for all</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
