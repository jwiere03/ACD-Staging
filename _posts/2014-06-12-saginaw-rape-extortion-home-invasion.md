<h2>Multiple Michigan Felony Charges</h2>
Welton D. Pulliam, a 23-year-old resident of Saginaw, MI, has been charged with multiple felonies as a result of an incident that occurred on April 28th in a west-side Saginaw apartment.

According to testimony given by the victim, Pulliam gave her a ride home. After she was inside, he came to the door and told her she had forgotten her cigarettes in his car. After she took the cigarettes from him she tried to close the door but Pulliam forced it open. He then dragged her to the bedroom and raped her.

After the rape, the victim said that Pulliam told her that if she told anyone about it he would kill her. After he left, the woman called police and reported the event. She also underwent a medical exam which provided conclusive evidence of rape-related injuries.

On May 14, prosecutors charged Pulliam with first-degree criminal sexual conduct during the commission of a felony or, in the alternative, first-degree criminal sexual conduct causing personal injury as well as first-degree home invasion and extortion. On May 19th, Michigan State Police troopers arrested Pulliam.

About two weeks later the Saginaw rape victim claims to have received a letter from Pulliam while he was in jail. As a result of the letter, prosecutors brought an additional charge against the accused, namely, interfering with a witness.

However, during the preliminary hearing on June 2nd, Saginaw County District Judge M.T. Thompson dismissed the charge of interfering with a witness, stating that the letter had not been signed by Pulliam and had also not been authenticated by authorities as having come from Pulliam.

Pulliam will stand trial in Circuit Court on charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct during the commission of a felony or, in the alternative, first-degree criminal sexual conduct causing personal injury as well as <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/home-invasion-1st-degree-michigan-home-invasion-attorneys.html" target="_blank">first-degree home invasion</a>. The date for the trial has not yet been scheduled.

<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html" target="_blank">First-degree criminal sexual conduct</a> is a felony that refers to sexual penetration in illegal circumstances. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. In addition, both the home invasion and extortion charges carry 20-year maximum penalties.

Pulliam remains in jail on a $150,000 bond.
