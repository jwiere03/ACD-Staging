&nbsp;

<a href="https://www.irs.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal Revenue Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRS) agents are specifically trained to detect tax fraud. Now, more and more, the work is being done by computers so as to eliminate human error, but there are still </span><b>thousands of IRS agents that conduct audits every year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can seem very scary to someone who isn't familiar with what they're looking for, so we're going to break it down for you.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What does the IRS look for in your taxes?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS agents are looking for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-tax-evasion-attorneys-failure-to-pay.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signs of fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not simple mistakes. Mistakes happen all the time, and most IRS agents aren't going to come after you because you miscalculated a number, or misunderstood a question on your income tax form. </span><b>People often make mistakes when filing their tax returns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because tax forms can be complicated. The IRS knows and understands this.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What they are looking for is signs of fraud. Indicators that you are </span><b>deliberately trying to cheat the government</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/financial-fraud-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the money you owe them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Common examples of tax fraud are:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claiming dependents that you don't have</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliberately underreporting income </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping two different sets of financial records (sometimes called "cooking the books")</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a fake or fraudulently obtained Social Security number</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submitting false receipts to increase deductions</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altering checks to increase deductions</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claiming dependents </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiding assets</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>How does the government determine if it's a mistake, or fraud?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the IRS computer looks over your tax return and decides that the discrepancies are more than just mistakes, it will be flagged for audit. At that point an IRS agent will look through your tax returns and documentation, and determine if the error was </span><b>a simple human screw-up, or a willful and intentional falsification</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If it's decided that fraud is the more likely answer, you will probably end up </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facing charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But don't worry, human error and everyday mistakes rarely result in tax fraud charges!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What happens if you're accused of tax fraud in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the suspected falsification was on state or city taxes, it will be investigated by the </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/treasury/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Department of Treasury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the suspected fraud was on your federal taxes, the IRS will investigate. </span><b>Whether you face state or federal charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be based on which taxes are suspect, and which agency does the investigation.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, </span><b>people caught cheating on their taxes face very serious charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Failure to file a tax return, submitting a false tax return, payment with intent to defraud, aiding and abetting tax evasion, and filing false returns with intent to defraud are all felonies! Anyone convicted of these crimes could face up to five years in prison, and up to $5,000 in fines.</span>
