Grab the pop corn and settle in for an evening of excellent court drama![/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're a regular follower of our blog, you'll remember the two part series we posted back in December of 2016 that listed </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lovers-law-collection-mysteries-set-mitten-state.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our favorite Michigan-based legal dramas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Well, we've have numerous conversations since then with clients and colleagues who've </span><b>read some of the books we recommended</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and thoroughly enjoyed them. But the question we keep getting asked is about movies. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Books are great, they tell us, but what about movies? Do we have favorite legal thrillers and dramas that we enjoy and identify with? We got talking and decided that it was time to </span><b>share our 'favorites' list with all those fans of the court out there!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chances are, you've already seen a few of these, but maybe you'll stumble across one you haven't watched yet. If so, you're welcome!</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Erin Brockovich</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An oldie but a true story goodie! Erin Brockovich pairs </span><b>the appeal of the underdog</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - she's an unemployed single mom - who takes on the might of a California power supply company and wins. After people in a small town start getting sick due to the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/federal-appeals-court-sends-flint-water-lawsuit-state-court.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pollution in their water supply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ( recklessly put there by a million dollar power company) this legal clerk sets out to make sure that the little guy doesn't get trampled under the feet of giants.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's </span><b>a modern day David and Goliath story</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A tale of dedication, compassion, and the importance of doing the right thing in the face of hardship. If you haven't seen it already, then do yourself a favor and rent it.</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1189340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>The Lincoln Lawyer</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a good one. Matthew McConaughey stars as "the Lincoln Lawyer" - a defense attorney who works out of the backseat of his Lincoln, which an assistant drives around for him as a sort of 'mobile office'. Based on a novel by bestselling author Michael Connelly, this story </span><b>deals with the difficult subject of guilt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Specifically, the guilt of one's client, who the lincoln lawyer believes may actually be guilty of far more than just </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the crimes he's charged with</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's an exciting story, full of suspense and drama, that does a great job of conveying </span><b>the ethical dilemmas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes faced by </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal defense attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So bust out the popcorn and enjoy one of the best legal thrillers made in the last decade. Seriously, why are you still reading this list? Go and watch it right now. Right now!</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104952/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>My Cousin Vinny</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another older film, but boy-oh-boy, this one has a cult following! My Cousin Vinny tells the story of two young men from New York who mistakenly get </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused of murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in rural Alabama. At a loss for how to handle their situation, they hire one of their cousins - loud mouth, fast talking Vinny - to represent them in court. Problem is, Vinny doesn't understand the way law is practiced in the South, and what's more - he's </span><b>never represented anyone accused of murder before!</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the story is hilarious, it does a great job of depicting of real courtroom procedure and trial strategy. </span><b>Many Hollywood versions of trials show a highly glamorized version of the court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So while it's a few years old, and many things have changed in the intervening years, this movie is a great place to start if you want to see what a 'normal', non-glamorized murder trial looks like. Plus, the story is great for a laugh!</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488120/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Fracture</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a complex and very interesting story. It charts the tale of a man </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-open-murder-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused of murdering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his unfaithful wife, and the district attorney who prosecuted him. It deals with fascinating subjects within the law, like </span><b>evidence that is ruled to be inadmissible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the issue of 'fruit of the poisonous tree.' </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Gosling plays a young, driven prosecuting attorney who's trying to put Anthony Hopkins' character behind bars for murder. But the situation keeps changing. No one is able to figure out how to put him behind bars. </span><b>Evidence gets tainted</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Facts are manipulated. In the end, did he do it or didn't he? And is he going to get away with murder? Boy, this sounds like a typical day at the office for the criminal attorneys at The Kronzek Firm. </span>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Michael Clayton</b></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This movie starts out explosively, and then whips you back in time to the events unfolding that led to that critical opening scene. After a lawyer representing a guilty company in a billion dollar class action lawsuit has a total breakdown, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the law firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brings in their 'fixer' to salvage the situation. </span><b>The fixer, however, has problems of his own</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This story stretches probability to the max, but it's a wonderfully enjoyable film, full of </span><b>unexpected twists and complex characters</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. George Clooney, Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson play their roles beautifully, and the script earned Michael Clayton rave reviews. If you haven't already seen this one, you should do yourself a favor and cancel your plans tonight. Watch this instead.</span>
