Answer: In every way![/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for joining us again for this discussion on unreliable eyewitness testimony. Thus far we've discussed the court's approach to eyewitness testimony, and </span><b>what the majority of research is revealing about how inconsistent and untrustworthy eyewitness testimony can be.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Moving forward, we will be looking at the science of memory today, and the effect it has on how we recall faces and events. For those of you just joining us, we recommend spending a few minutes getting </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/eyewitness-testimony-can-really-trust-eyes-part-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caught up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, for those of you who have been along for the ride from the beginning, let's get to it...</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Richard L. Huganir, Director of the Department of Neuroscience at </span><a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johns Hopkins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when we learn anything new at all, we form connections between the  neurons in the brain, called synapses. They then create new circuits between nerve cells. </span><b>Those synapses get stronger or weaker depending on how often we’re exposed to an event.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In other words, the more you're exposed to something, the stronger the connections get. Less exposure, however, means weaker connections. That explains why it can be so hard to remember things after only </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lineup.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeing or hearing them once</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Recall that repetition always make it easier to remember things. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, eyewitnesses to a crime, or for witnesses who see the suspect at the scene, </span><b>this is the first time they are ever seeing that person</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means their exposure to the person accused of committing the crime is very brief, and so the synaptic connection formed for that memory is very weak.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, memories are subtly reconstructed in the brain every time they are recounted. People </span><b>edit out details they believe to be extraneous, or focus on details that they believe to be relevant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their listener. This in turn affects the way they recall the event, so that the next time they tell the story, it is often slightly changed by the way they told it previously. When recounting events to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is of particular concern.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Witnesses who talk to police often remember events and people incorrectly in their retelling.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a talk given by Barbara Tversky, Professor of Psychology and George Fisher, Professor of Law at Stanford, they discuss the issue of how memory can be effected without any outside influences. "</span><b>Memory is affected by retelling, and we rarely tell a story in a neutral fashion.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By tailoring our stories to our listeners, our bias distorts the very formation of memory—even without the introduction of misinformation by a third party." The result they say, is that eyewitness testimony is innately suspect.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking into account the weak synaptic connection and the fact that the story is likely to change slightly every time it is recalled and retold, </span><b>there is another factor that influences memories - emotion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a widely accepted consensus that strong emotions have an impact on memory formation. Stress and fear can cause acute and chronic changes in certain areas of the human brain, which can actually cause long-term damage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, over-secretion of stress hormones often impairs memory. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are differences of opinion about how acute stress affects memory formation, both schools of thought point to difficulties in accurately recalling information. </span><b>This is supported by studies that have conclusively shown that stress may enhance memory formation, but impairs memory retrieval.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All of this proves that witnesses that are present during high stress events - shooting, robberies, rapes, kidnappings, etc - are not likely to recall events and people as accurately as they would be able to under less stressful circumstances.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us next time as we take a look at how suggestive questioning can affect the way memories are recalled, making </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police interviewing techniques</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> very questionable during investigations.
