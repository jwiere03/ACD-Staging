&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">26-year-old Jason Hogan, a resident of Detroit, is accused of</span><b> committing a hate crime against an LGBTQ person, along with other firearms charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The reason for the hate crime change in addition, is because Thornton is alleged to have shot a transgender woman in the face after engaging in a voluntary sexual act with her.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police records show that on January 13th, Hogan is said to have met with the victim, at which time he paid her in exchange for a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sexually-delinquent-person.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual encounter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was to take place in the back of his car. </span><b>After the sex act was completed, Hogan allegedly shot the woman in the face with a handgun, which police say they have identified as a 9mm Ruger</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The victim was able to flee the vehicle and seek help. She was treated at Grace Hospital and survived the injury. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Detroit Police opened an investigation which lasted for nine days and resulted in Hogan's arrest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has been charged with a single count of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault With Intent to Commit Murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a felony under Michigan law that is punishable by up to life in prison. In addition, Hogan has also been charged with </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is punishable by two years in prison.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The charges have been brought by the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, in conjunction with the </span><a href="https://www.fairmichigan.org/fair-michigan-justice-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair Michigan Justice Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  (FMJP). The FMJP is, according to its website, a collaboration between Fair Michigan and the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office, which "</span><b>focuses on homicides and other capital offenses committed against members of the LGBTQ community.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, the FMJP special prosecutor Jaimie Powell Horowitz will be handling the prosecution. </span><b>At his arraignment, Hogan was granted a $250,000 cash bond</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His preliminary examination is scheduled for February 6th in the 36th District Court in Detroit, before the Honorable Judge Kenneth J. King.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><b>This case highlights the mortal danger faced by transgender individuals in Michigan.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">says Julia Abad, the Fair Michigan Director of Transgender Outreach. She also points out that since Michigan law "permits employment discrimination against LGBTQ residents, trans people sometimes must resort to sex work in order to survive, which puts them at extreme risk of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"It is incredibly encouraging to know," Abad explains, "that The Fair Michigan Justice Project, the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayne County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Prosecutor's Office and the Detroit Police Department have stated, in no uncertain terms, that </span><b>violence against the trans community is unacceptable under any circumstances and that these agencies stand ready to aggressively prosecute</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these brutal crimes committed."</span>
