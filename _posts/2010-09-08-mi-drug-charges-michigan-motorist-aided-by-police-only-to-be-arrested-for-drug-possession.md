If law enforcement officials witness a car pulled over to the side of the road, their first inclination is to assist the motorist. However, should the police believe that the person has something to hide,  their helpful intentions could turn from assisting to investigating.  Any criminal lawyer in Michigan will warn you: a routine traffic stop can easily turn into arrest if the police believe that the motorist is acting unlawfully. Such are the circumstances in a recent case where officers arrested a Michigan man after discovering illegal drugs in his vehicle.

Law enforcement officials from Van Buren County spotted a 26 year-old man struggling with his vehicle at the Brandywine Lake public access. The officers stopped to assist the motorist with his car troubles, but immediately noticed that he was "acting extremely nervous." His strange behavior suggested to police that he was in possession of some unlawful materials. The motorist granted his permission for the deputies to investigate the car, where they located various illegal narcotics including three grams of methamphetamine and six boxes of pseudoephedrine, as well as drug paraphernalia.

<h2>Driver arrested for meth possession and meth components</h2>

Van Buren County sheriff's deputies immediately arrested the driver for drug charges in Michigan, specifically possession of meth and meth components. As a schedule 1 drug, those caught in <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">possession of methamphetamine</a> will face serious legal consequences, including stiff fines, probation, and even jail time.

Many individuals caught in possession of illegal substances and narcotics are often addicted to the drugs, willing to do anything to use. Unfortunately, the legal system tends to incarcerate these individuals where their addictions will only grow more intense, ultimately making their chances of becoming a repeat offender much higher. Instead of jail time, substance abusers need rehabilitation to appropriately defeat their addictions. This will not only ensure that the person does not relapse, but also that they do not cross paths with the law for a second time.

To fight for the right to rehabilitation over incarceration, one needs to pro-actively secure the best legal defense for their case. By contacting knowledgeable and hard-working <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">criminal attorneys in Michigan</a>, a defendant will receive the highest quality legal advice and legal representation, designed to guide you through the complex process. Taking this step is the first in ensuring that you receive the rehabilitation necessary for recovery, while still maintaining your personal freedoms and liberties.
