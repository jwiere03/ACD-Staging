&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back, and thanks for joining us here at The Kronzek Firm for our discussion on </span><b>junk science, which is often mistaken for real forensic science</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! This is an important topic for defendants facing a criminal trial in Michigan. We regularly see prosecutors and their expert witnesses trying to sell their junk science theories to juries in Lansing, Grand Rapids, and Livingston and Shiawassee County. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far we've been looking at the different </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controversial methods used by cops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prosecutors throughout Michigan including Oakland County and Macomb County to get convictions. If you're only just joining us you might want to take a moment to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cutting-edge-crime-scene-tech-junk-science-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get caught up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Otherwise, having wrapped up our list of junk sciences, we'd like to look at how these "tried and true" methods came under fire in recent years!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Movies and TV shows haven't helped the issue!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most civilians don't really understand what's involved in fingerprint comparison, or DNA analysis, but they know their favorite TV cop character uses these methods to put the bad guys in prison. So they must be real science, right? Shows like </span><a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/csi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460627/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309152/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI Files</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NCIS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have all </span><b>normalized the idea of forensic sciences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being solid and infallible in mainstream society. People no longer question the validity of forensic sciences, because on TV they seem so impartial and real.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>So when did people start questioning forensic sciences?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a trickle at first. One conviction overturned, when </span><b>the scientific methods used were proven to be groundless</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And then another, and another and another. Slowly, over the course of many years, scientists, criminal defense attorneys and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">falsely convicted people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drew more and more attention to the questionable nature of so many forensic techniques.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The major shift came in 2009, when the National Academy of Sciences released their</span><a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12589/strengthening-forensic-science-in-the-united-states-a-path-forward"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> groundbreaking 2009 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which </span><b>blew the lid off forensics forever</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Suddenly methods and techniques that had been considered failsafe for years were being called into question. Things like fingerprint comparison, footwear pattern analysis, bite marks and firearm identification were suddenly no longer rock solid evidence to convict someone accused of a crime. And yet they continued to be used in courtrooms around the state of Michigan and other parts of the USA. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is being done to improve forensic sciences and avoid 'junk science'?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the answer to that question is "not enough." But not all is lost! Even The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) have noted the problem. Ther opinion? </span><b>Forensic science has validity problems which need to addressed immediately</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Specifically, methods used to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convict people of crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to have foundational or applied validity. So what does that mean?</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Foundational Validity:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means the forensic discipline in question is based on research whose results are “repeatable, reproducible, and accurate."</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Applied Validity:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the method in question is "reliably applied in practice." In essence, if the forensic method is to be used in court, there need to be reproducible studies on its accuracy, and it needs to be an accurate method used by examiners. Michigan’s Rules of Evidence rely on the Daubert standard combined with some elements of the old Davis-Freye test, to help judges decide whether to admit evidence at trial. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Don’t be falsely accused based on junk science!</b></h2>
