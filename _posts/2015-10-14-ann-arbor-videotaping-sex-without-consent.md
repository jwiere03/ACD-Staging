<h2><b>Former U of M player Charged with Videotaping Sex Without Consent</b></h2>
<b></b>Logan Tuley-Tillman, a former U of M football player who was dismissed from the program last month, was recently charged with several felonies.  He was arraigned in the 15th District Court in Ann Arbor, where he is said to have stood mute beside his attorney, Douglas Lewis.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuley-Tillman is charged with two counts of capturing/distributing an image of an unclothed person, and one count of using a computer to commit a crime. Under Michigan law, the first charge is a felony punishable by up to two years in prison, and a fine of no more than $2,000, or both. The latter, also a felony in this particular case, would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and possible fines of up to $5,000, or both.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police records show that on September 4th, Tuley-Tillman allegedly filmed a portion of a consensual sexual encounter with a woman without her knowledge or permission. He then apparently transferred the video to his personal device. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note here that the sexual encounter was entirely consensual between two adults. However, Michigan law requires that all recordings of sexual encounters, however brief and despite the consensual nature, be made with the full knowledge and permission of both parties. Failure to do so means you could be accused of videotaping sex without consent. Which can get you into a great deal of trouble, as Tuley-Tillman is finding out. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sophomore offensive lineman was kicked off the U of M football team on September 5th. Coach Jim Harbaugh issued a release to the media, explaining that Tuley-Tillman was being removed from the team for "conduct unacceptable for a Michigan student."</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuley-Tillman's next two court appearances have already been scheduled. He will be appearing on November 5th for a probable cause hearing, and on November 12th for his preliminary hearing. As of now he is free on a $5,000 personal bond.</span>
