&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thanks for joining us here at The Kronzek Firm for this discussion on teen pranks, and how they can actually result in criminal charges. In </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/teenage-pranks-can-lead-criminal-charges-pt-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our previous article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we talked about how </span><b>online access has changed the way teens prank nowadays</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how public perception of teen pranks has changed as well. (Paintballing a house was considered annoying years ago, but now it's viewed as vandalism or malicious destruction of property, which is a crime here in Michigan!)</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem silly to some parents, but the shenanigans their kids get up to can </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">land them behind bars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in some cases, with </span><b>a criminal record that can haunt them for the rest of their lives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! However, when you consider what is considered a "prank" in today's world, maybe it's not so preposterous after all! </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Some teen pranks have become riskier, and more dangerous!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Toilet papering someone's house or egging their windows might make for a lot of hard work for the homeowner, but it never put anyone in danger. However those are no longer the only kind of pranks being pulled these days by kids in Michigan. The internet has made </span><b>every ill-advised idea available to everyone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and with everyone wanting their 15 minutes of fame on YouTube, many kids simply can't resist. But the reality can be terrifying!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of how out of control teen pranking can get, you only have to look at the case currently making its way through the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/genesee-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genesee County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Court right now, involving several </span><b>teenage boys who threw rocks at passing cars from a highway overpass</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You'll probably agree it wasn't a smart move - a windshield could have shattered, or a driver could have been startled, jerking the wheel and losing control of their vehicle at high speed. In reality, however, the results were much worse!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>5 Michigan teens are being charged with murder for their "prank" </b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five teen boys, aged 15 through 17, are accused of dropping large rocks and a tire from an overpass near Flint, which resulted in </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">considerable damage to several vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the death of one young father. 32-year-old Kenneth White was a passenger in a van that was travelling on the I-75 near Flint, when a twenty pound </span><b>rock crashed through the windshield, striking him in the face and chest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, before bouncing onto his chest and crushing it. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The van's driver told police</span><b> he had to pass four other cars, all pulled to the side of the highway and damaged</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, before could help his friend. Sadly, White was declared dead shortly after being hit by the flying rock. The five teens have all been charged with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Degree Murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a number of other charges, including conspiracy to commit murder, and multiple counts of felony </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malicious Destruction of Property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are all being charged as adults in the Genessee County courts.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Teens often fail to think through the consequences of their actions</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teens are not stupid. However, it's a widely recognized fact that their brains have not finished developing yet, and they're subject to raging hormones and enormous social pressures. None of this is an excuse for what happened, of course, but the reality is that these kids are exactly that - just kids. </span><b>And they are facing life in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Obviously, very sad.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">White's fiance believes they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be put away for life because they should have known better. Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton and Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell agree, although both say it caused them heartache to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-convictions-among-juveniles-terrifying-facts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charge these children for this crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "</span><b>It's not a prank, it's second-degree murder,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" Pickell said in a statement to the press. "I don't think anybody is laughing and I think that if there's any warning that both David and I can give, is telling young people, you make a bad decision, you could be spending the rest of your life in prison!"</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Teens facing criminal charges need very specific help!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Juveniles who are facing criminal charges are a different kettle of fish from the average adult dealing with the criminal justice system. </span><b>Minors need to be handled differently</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and when they're being charged as juveniles, the court system doesn't handle their cases in the same way. That's why teens need </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/reviews-testimonials-clients.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a skilled criminal defense attorney who understands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what they're up against, what alternatives are available to them, and how best to protect their rights, and their futures.</span>
