But how? Read on to find out...[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun laws are one of those controversial subjects endlessly being debated here in Michigan. Does safety trump second amendment rights? </span><b>What's more important - a person's right to bear arms, or a community's right to be free from weapons.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guns used more for crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or for protection? These questions aren't likely to go away anytime soon, and our legislature is constantly readdressing the issue of gun safety. So what are the most recent changes and proposed changes? We break it down for you in this three part series.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Allowing concealed guns to be carried without a permit:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The is legislation currently pending that would change Michigan's concealed carry permit laws. Under the new law, legal gun owners could </span><b>carry a concealed gun without needing a permit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We wrote about </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/may-not-register-michigan-pistol-future.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this possible change to state gun laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month, and explained what the possible changes would mean.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under this potential law, Michigan residents would </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no longer be required to register their handguns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the state. For those people who are already registered, this bill would allow them to </span><b>request that the Michigan State Police remove their names and information from the state registry</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, this bill would eliminate the $250 fine that state law currently assigns to everyone who fails to register a handgun. This new proposed law would not allow people that are prohibited from carrying to now start carrying a weapon. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Banning civilians from carrying guns in police stations:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early February of this year, two men walked into a police station in Dearborn, Michigan with guns. Although the officers on site were able to handle the situation, not every similar instance is so easily dealt with. This legislation, introduced to the House of Representatives would </span><b>ban a person from carrying a gun into a police station with a posted sign banning firearms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unless they were there to relinquish it to an officer. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Criminalizing guns left where minors can access them easily:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill, which was introduced by the Senate, would </span><b>make it illegal for a gun owner to store a gun in such a way that it is accessible to a minor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under this potential law, a gun owner would be required to lock the firearm, keep it in a locked container, or store it in a location that a reasonable person would believe was secure. Failure to do so </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could result in criminal charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on how the gun was used by a minor or unauthorized person.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Michigan State Police website reminds us, "Firearm ownership carries with it a responsibility of safeguarding the welfare of others and you when handling firearms. </span><b>Accident prevention is the user's responsibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." The MSP recommends using a gun case or locked cabinet to keep unsupervised children and intruders from finding and using Â a homeowner's guns.</span>
