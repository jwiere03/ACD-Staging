Michigan and Texas have very different views about marijuana. And by "different", we mean "practically irreconcilable". After all, while medical marijuana is legal in Michigan, and small quantities have been decriminalized in certain cities around the state, Texas has retained it's zero tolerance policy for marijuana in any form.<!--more-->

But regardless of how opposed their views may be on the subject, chances are that neither state would have looked kindly on the 118 pounds of marijuana found in the trunk of a car.
<h2>Routine Traffic Stop Uncovers 118 Pounds Of Marijuana</h2>
According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, a trooper pulled the two women over on Interstate 40 for a traffic violation. The trooper ultimately searched their vehicle, a Hyundai Elantra. In the trunk, the officer discovered many bundles of marijuana, totaling 118 pounds.

The two women, 31-year-old Teuta Hajdini of Dearborn, and 27-year-old Adelina Dedvukai of Farmington Hills, were arrested and are being held without bond in the Potter County Jail. They have been charged with possession and delivery of marijuana over 50 pounds but less than 2,000 pounds.

Texas investigators believe that the marijuana was being transported from Tempe, Arizona to Dearborn, Michigan for resale. It's value is listed at $716,000.

According to <a href="http://norml.org/" target="_blank">NORML</a>, under Texas law, possession of marijuana over 50 pounds but less than 2,000 pounds is a felony punishable by anywhere from 2 to 20 years in prison, and fines of up to $10,000. In addition, delivery (also called sale) of marijuana over 50 pounds but less than 2,000 pounds is also a felony punishable by anywhere from 5 up to 99 years in prison, and a fine of up to  $10,000.

Michigan marijuana law differs somewhat from Texas law in that our state has enacted a medical marihuana law. However, for people growing and selling marijuana without the coverage that the state affords through the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/medical-marijuana.html" target="_blank">Michigan Medical Marihuana Act</a>, the penalties can still be quite severe. Although, admittedly, not nearly as severe as in Texas.

Had they been arrested here in Michigan and not in Texas, the pair would most likely have been charged with possession. In Michigan, possession of any amount of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a $2,000 fine. Delivery, or Intent to deliver, on the other hand, is an entirely different kettle of fish.

Under Michigan law, delivery of marijuana is classified by weight, as it is in Texas. However Texas uses pounds, and Michigan uses kilograms. 118 pounds, as in this case, would equal just over 53 kilograms, which under Michigan law would be classified as being "45 kilograms or more" by the penal code. This is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and a possible fine of up to $10,000,000. (yes, it really is that much money!)

Regardless of how much marijuana the cops find, it is important to get a good criminal defense attorney on your side immediately if you are arrested for marijuana possession.  Your right to freedom could well be at stake.
