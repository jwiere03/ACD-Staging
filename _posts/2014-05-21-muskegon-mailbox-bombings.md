<h2><b>Three Teenagers Arrested &amp; ChargedÂ </b></h2>
Three teenaged boys have been arrested and charged in connection with a series of mailbox bombings that occurred recently in Muskegon County, MI.

Alec Arthur Curow, a 17-year-old resident of Muskegon, Jacob Tyler, an 18-year-old, and his 15-year-old brother Brendan Tyler, both of Whitehall, have been arrested and charged with two felonies each. The younger Tyler brother will go through juvenile court.

All three boys have been charged with placing explosive substances near property causing property damage, which stems from their allegedly placing multiple explosive devices near a home. The bombs exploded and damaged a house and a car on North Weber Road. This is a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $15,000.00, or both.

They have also all been charged with placing explosive substances near property causing alarm. This charge is the result of their having allegedly placed pop-bottle explosives in several mailboxes, one of which was "completely obliterated" when it detonated, said Muskegon County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Timothy Maat. This is also a felony punishable by up to fifteen years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.00, or both.

According to Assistant Prosecutor Maat, the bombs are "devices that use 2-liter pop bottles filled with Drano, which creates a chemical reaction when they blow up. It can cause some serious damage!"

The person who lives in the property on North Weber Road that was damaged by one of the explosives was apparently a "targeted victim," according to the assistant prosecutor's office. The mailboxes that were blown up belonged to a people that the suspects both knew and didn't know. It is currently not known how Curow and the Tyler brothers know each other.

A preliminary examination has been scheduled in the Muskegon County District Court.
