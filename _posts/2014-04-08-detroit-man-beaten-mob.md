<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Multiple Arrests for Assault</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Driving through Detroit's East side, Steve Utash was on his way home from his job as a tree trimmer, when a 10 year old child ran out in front of his car. Utash wasn't able to stop in time and hit the child by accident. Concerned, he stopped his car and got out to help. And that was when a mob of angry people attacked and beat him to within an inch of his life. According to witnesses, Utash was crying out apologies and begging for mercy. He suffered multiple head injuries and swelling on the brain, and is currently in a medically induced coma in critical condition at St. John Hospital and Medical Center.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The incident was captured on the security cameras of a nearby gas station. Police have stated that Utash is not at fault for the accident and that he did the right thing by stopping to offer aid. But the beating, which authorities have called "vigilante style", has resulted in multiple arrests and police are hoping for more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bruce Wimbush Jr, a 17 year old who was involved in the beating, has been arrested and charged with assault with intent to commit murder and do great bodily harm, a felony charge which can result in imprisonment for life. His arraignment is scheduled for this morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Courtney Robinson, a 16 year old boy has also been arrested. He was held in a juvenile detention facility until authorities could determine whether or not to charge him as an adult. He was charged in juvenile court with assault with intent to murder and may yet face charges as an adult.</p>
On Sunday evening a 30 year old man was arrested, and on Monday morning a 24 year old man. Their names have not yet been released to the public. Police say there were about 11 people involved in the beating and they are calling on witnesses to step forward and assist them in their investigation.
