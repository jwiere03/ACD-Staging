<h2><b>Charges Against Elderly Man Dropped</b></h2>
Felony assault charges filed against an elderly man from Bay County have been dropped. Â Artur Buss was accused of pointing a pellet gun at a couple from his backyard, which resulted in criminal charges against him.

On May 13th, in the early evening, a couple were looking at a home for sale in the 3100 block of East Midland Road in Bangor Township, when they noticed an elderly man standing in his yard and pointing a rifle at them.<!--more-->

The man was about 80 yards away, in his own backyard, armed with a .177-caliber Ruger Air Hawk Rifle. Frightened that they would be fired at, the couple fled. As they drove away, they noticed the man was pointing his middle finger at them.

The couple, Jonathan and Jennifer Turmell, called the police to report the incident,. They were met by a Michigan State Police trooper in the parking lot of the Texan Family Restaurant on N. Euclid Ave, where they explained what had happened.

Police went to the man's house and questioned him about the incident. 75-year-old Buss, the alleged rifle owner, denied pointing a gun at the couple, but did tell officers that he owned a pellet gun, which he kept in his shed.

Officers had the Turmells come to Buss' house and identify him, which they did. Officers arrested Buss and he was subsequently charged with two felony counts of assault with a dangerous weapon. Bay County District Judge Dawn A. Klida released Buss on a personal recognizance bond, with the condition that he have no contact with the Turmells.

However, Bay County District Judge Mark E. Janer dismissed the charges on Thursday, June 5th at the request of the prosecution. Under Michigan law, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-assault-dangerous-weapon-attorneys.html" target="_blank">assault with a dangerous weapon</a> is a felony punishable by imprisonment for up to 4 years, or a fine of up to $2,000.00, or both.

Bay County Prosecutor Kurt C. Asbury has not yet made public the reasons that prompted the dismissal.
