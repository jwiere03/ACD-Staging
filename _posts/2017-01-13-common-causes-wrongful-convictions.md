&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our recent four-part article series, we discussed at length the issue of false confessions, and why they are such a tragedy. Those articles have sparked considerable debate, and </span><b>one of the issues that was brought up time and time again is the issue of wrongful convictions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we thought we would share with you some information from the University of Michigan's </span><a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/clinical/innocenceclinic/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innocence Clinic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the most common causes of wrongful convictions.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Innocence Clinic, there are many possible reasons why a person could be wrongfully convicted of a crime. However, the most common reasons can be summed up in the following six categories:1</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>False Confessions:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We already covered this one at length, so if you didn't read our </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-confessions-lie-isnt-actually-lie-part-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article series on false confessions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we would recommend that you take a few minutes and look it over. Don't believe that an innocent person can confess to a crime they didn't commit? Well, you're in for a big surprise! The facts are astounding, and you may learn a thing or two that will change the way you watch crime dramas on TV.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Junk Science:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Junk science is defined as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">untested or unproven theories that are presented as scientific fact, usually in a court of law. According to the Innocence Clinic, there are a number of forensic testing methods that are considered to be unreliable, </span><a href="http://childprotectiveservicesdefense.com/u-m-law-school-gets-grant-review-shaken-baby-cases.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lacking in validation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or simply incorrect. Forensic analysts sometimes testify in court without having accurate information or repeatable results to back up their claims.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Eyewitness Testimony:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has long been know</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n that no two people see a situation, event or person the same way. In the words of Steven R. Covey, "Two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right. It's not logical; it's psychological." This is no more true than when it comes to eyewitness testimony. In fact, according to the Michigan Innocence Clinic, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lineup.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eyewitness misidentification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is probably the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions throughout the U.S.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>"Snitching":</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've ever watched a crime drama (and we wager that you probably have), then you've heard of snitches - people who provide testimony against someone else in return for something they want. A 'jailhouse snitch' will usually testify against someone else in return for a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduced sentence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or some other benefit that will make their time in jail more pleasant. Others, not in jail, will provide incriminating testimony in return for money or other favors. In most cases, the incentives are not revealed to the jury.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Government Misconduct:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, government officials will push a case through in order to gain the conviction they want, despite shaky evidence or even clear proof of innocence. This can happen in the form of prosecutorial misconduct, police misconduct, withholding evidence that is favorable to the accused, fraud, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence tampering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and intentional negligence.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Poor Legal Representation:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it's a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/court-appointed-attorneys" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court appointed attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who only meets with their client minutes before the hearing begins, or worse - doesn't even show up, or an overworked attorney who can't keep up with the cases assigned to them - bad lawyering accounts for a surprising amount of wrongful convictions.</span>

&nbsp;
