Of all the criminal charges possible, society considers sexual offenses among the most heinous. Because of this, those accused of criminal sexual conduct or other sex crimes in Michigan face serious trouble and require the services of an experienced, tough sex crime lawyer in Michigan right away. Not only is it possible for the accused to face large fines and lengthy prison sentences, a convicted person must also repeatedly submit information to the state Sex Offender Registry, publicly setting a blemish on their record. For those who are public employees such as firefighters, police, or city officials, the punishment for a sex crime conviction can also include the loss of employment and public ridicule.

These circumstances are seen in a recent case where a law enforcement deputy was arrested for assault and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank">sex crimes in Michigan</a> after allegedly beating a relative and forcing her to engage in sexual acts.

In September 2010, 14-year Wayne County Police veteran Roderick Calhoun, 42, allegedly beat the victim with a belt and attempted to choke her in his Livonia home. According to the police report, Calhoun was living with the victim in a home with another relative, who had already left the home for work that day prior to the assault.

After hitting his relative, Calhoun supposedly brandished a handgun, threatening the victim and forcing her to perform sexual acts. Immediately following the incident, the victim reported the crime to local law enforcement officials, prompting police to arrest Calhoun shortly afterward. Currently, he is being held on a laundry list of offenses including four counts of third-degree sexual assault, assault with intent to do great bodily harm, felonious assault and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime. In total, the indictment against Calhoun lists 11 felony counts with a maximum of 15 years behind bars if found guilty.
<h2>Law Enforcement Not Only Facing Criminal Charges but Disciplinary Action</h2>
As if the criminal charges against Calhoun are not enough, he also faces disciplinary action at work as well. At this time, he is suspended from his position at the Wayne County Sheriff's Office and is not likely to receive any special treatment because of his law enforcement position in the department. "These are very serious charges, and we will treat the prosecution of Roderick Calhoun just as we would any other defendant," explained Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy. Even if he is acquitted, the charges currently against Calhoun could be enough to ruin his personal and professional reputation permanently in Detroit.

As seen by the example of Wayne County Deputy Roderick Calhoun, being accused of criminal sexual conduct is a scary and difficult experience for anyone to go through regardless of their occupation. Because the consequences of a sex crime, rape or molestation conviction are so severe, it is essential to contact hard-working and aggressive sex crime attorneys in Michigan for assistance.
