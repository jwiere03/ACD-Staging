<h2>Murder Charges Could Mean Life in Prison</h2>
A shooting in Inkster has resulted in one man dead and another facing murder charges that could put him behind bars for the rest of his life. Brandon Oscar Leroy Benson, a 22-year-old Detroit man, has been arraigned on murder charges in the Inkster District Court. He is accused of fatally shooting Joel Rustin, a 21-year-old resident of Inkster.<!--more-->

According to Michigan State Police records, the incident took place on December 28th. Rustin was sitting in his living room on a couch, when Benson walked up to the house and began firing shots through the window.

MSP says that multiple shots were fired from outside of the house on Yale Street. Rustin was transported to a local hospital, but was declared dead upon arrival. Police were contacted about the shooting at about 7:30 in the evening, and an investigation was immediately opened.

No information has been released regarding how police came to suspect Benson, or how long it took before they decided they had enough evidence to arrest him. But Benson was arrested, and was arraigned on murder charges within four days of the shooting.

He is facing numerous charges in connection with the incident, including felony murder, felony firearm, and accessory after the fact to a felony. He is also being charged as a habitual offender, as this is his fourth offense. If convicted, Benson is facing the possibility of life in prison.

Under Michigan law, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">felony murder</a> refers to murder that was committed while another felony crime was being committed. It is punishable by up to life in prison. <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank">Felony firearm</a> is punishable by up to two years in prison, while <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/accessory-after-fact-michigan.html" target="_blank">accessory after the fact</a> could earn you as many as five years behind bars. The habitual offender status serves to increase the penalties of other crimes.

According to MSP, the case is still under investigation. And, as of yet, no explanation or motive has been provided for why Benson allegedly shot Rustin. We may have to wait until the trial to hear what Benson's defense attorney has to say.
