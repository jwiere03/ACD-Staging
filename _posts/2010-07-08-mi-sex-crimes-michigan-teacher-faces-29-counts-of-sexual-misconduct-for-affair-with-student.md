Any experienced sex crime attorneys in Michigan can verify that being suspected of committing a sex crime is a scary experience for anyone to go through. Conviction of criminal sexual conduct will carry harsh punishments, including mandatory compliance with the Sex Offender Registry and likely jail time. Sometimes it is possible for the convicted sex offender to lose their job as well, particularly if they work in close proximity to children. An example with similar circumstances is seen in the recent case of a Michigan teacher who was arraigned on 29 counts of sexual misconduct with a student.
<h2>Affair With Student Leads To Charges</h2>
According to a Midland County prosecutor, 33 year-old former teacher Marcie Rosseau was arrested for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank">criminal sexual conduct in Michigan</a>. From May 2009 to February 2010, Rosseau allegedly had sexual relations with a 16 year-old student. Prosecutor Angelina Scarpelli maintains that the former teacher picked the teen up in her vehicle and drove across county lines to have sex with him. In light of the charges against the married mother of two, police are also investigating other possible victims dating back to 2002.

During the criminal investigation, Rosseau was placed on administrative leave, however she formally resigned from her position within the school system on June 16. This month, the former educator appeared in court for arraignment where she was officially charged with 21 counts of criminal sexual conduct on Monday, and another eight counts on Tuesday. Rosseau, who maintains her innocence, entered not guilty pleas in response to the charges.

If she is convicted of the pending charges, losing her job will be the least of Rosseau's problems. Not only will she be required to submit personal information to the Sex Offender Registry for 25 years, but the former teacher will almost certainly spend time behind bars. Clearly, accusations of sex crimes are not to be taken lightly--your livelihood and enjoyed liberties will undoubtedly suffer as a result.
