Marvin Robinson is a Safety on the University of Michigan football team. He has been accused of entering someone’s dorm room at the University of Michigan and stealing an Xbox video game system. He was charged with <a title="Michigan Home Invasion Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-home-invasion-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html">Second Degree Home Invasion</a>. His arraignment was held on November 8, 2011 and he will soon face a preliminary exam at a District Court in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

As <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com">criminal defense attorneys</a>, we know the consequences of being convicted of a Home Invasion crime. Second Degree Home Invasion is a felony in Michigan, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, a fine of up to $3,000, or both. To convict a defendant of Home Invasion in the Second Degree, a prosecutor needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant broke into and entered a dwelling –or– the defendant entered a dwelling without permission, or (2) the defendant had formed the intent to commit a larceny, felony, or assault by the time he or she entered the dwelling –or– the defendant actually committed one of those crimes while entering, present in, or exiting the dwelling.

<h2>A defendant is deemed innocent until proven guilty</h2>

Michigan football coach Brady Hoke stated, “We are aware of the report. We will let the legal process run its course, and we will not have any further comment until that time.” In Michigan and the rest of the United States, a criminal defendant is deemed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. To some criminal defendants, especially high-profile defendants like Marvin Robinson, it may not feel they are being treated as if they are innocent. It is part of the job of a <a title="Michigan Criminal Defense Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html">good defense lawyer</a> to remind judges, prosecutors, and the public of this presumption of innocence.

If you or someone else has been charged with any type of Home Invasion or Burglary crime, you should contact a criminal defense attorney immediately.
