&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">48-year-old Christine Reiss, the ex-wife of former Greenville, MI police chief Mark Reiss, was recently found guilty of health care fraud. According to Montcalm County court records, the jury found her guilty of </span><b>continuing to use her ex husband's health care, even after the pair was divorced</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The charges have not only affected Christine. </span><b>Mark Reiss is also in the hot seat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a pending trial scheduled for June 6th where he will face charges of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/health-care-fraud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">health care fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine Reiss and her husband </span><b>divorced in August of 2014</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though, according to the Michigan State Police investigation, she continued to use her ex husband's health care as if they were still married. Blue Cross Blue Shield received an anonymous tip about the fraud, which they passed on to the MSP for further investigation.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Michigan State Police, in Greenville, Montcalm County, all city employees are required to inform the city when there are </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/white-collar-crimes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">status changes in their lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This would include marriages, divorces and deaths in the family. Mark Reiss' defense attorney says that he mentioned his divorce on a number of occasions at work, and also </span><b>told several city officials about it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He certainly wasn't trying to hide it. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that may not have been enough. The prosecutor's office claims that Mark </span><b>allowed his wife to continue using his health care</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after their divorce, which they say is fraudulent.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Court documents show that Mark failed to remove Christine from his Blue Cross health policy after their divorce was final. Christine Reiss is accused of illegally using her husband's health care on nine separate occasions, which is said to have </span><b>cost Blue Cross Blue Shield a total of $113,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under federal law, health care fraud is defined as "knowingly and </span><b>willfully executing a plan to defraud a health care benefit program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or to falsely obtaining property from a health care benefit program." It's connected with the delivery or payment for health care services or products that you are not legally entitled to. Although Reiss was convicted of the state of Michigan crime rather than the federal crime, the definitions remain similar. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine was accused of ten criminal charges in connection with this case. However, </span><b>the jury only found her guilty on three counts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, namely </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a False Claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Making a False Statement and Concealing Information. Judge Mark Trusock ordered her jailed and scheduled her sentencing for June 22, 2017 in the Kent County Circuit Court. The case was moved to Kent County from Montcalm County because of possible conflicts of interest involving the former Greenville Police Chief. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Health care fraud is a serious crime, and carries severe penalties under both federal and state law. A person convicted of health care fraud is likely to face </span><b>years in prison and steep fines</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in addition to the likelihood that they will be excluded from all federal healthcare programs. </span>
