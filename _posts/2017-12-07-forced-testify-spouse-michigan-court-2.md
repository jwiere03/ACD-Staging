&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many things we get from movies, besides entertainment, is a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/defenses-to-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">misunderstanding of the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This happens because writers and directors adapt facts to suit their storyline. This makes sense when </span><b>the purpose is to entertain, not to inform, teach or provide advice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But many people don't take the "unreality" of movies and TV shows into account, and as a result, they end up getting the wrong idea about lots of laws.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good example of this would be the spousal privilege law. Most people have heard references to the fact that "</span><b>a wife can't testify against her husband in court</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." Yet not many people really understand what the spousal privilege law is, or how it could affect Michigan couples.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Can a person be forced to testify against their spouse in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious? We thought you'd be. Let's break it downâ€¦ </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ttykmm52g343okdpeyxitxc3))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-600-2162"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that "in a criminal prosecution, a husband </span><b>shall not be examined as a witness for or against</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his wife without his consent, or a wife for or against her husband without her consent" except in the following situations:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a suit for </span><a href="https://www.midmichigandivorce.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">divorce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, separate maintenance, or annulment.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a prosecution for bigamy.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a prosecution for a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crime committed against a child</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of a personal wrong or injury done by one to the other</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case where one spouse doesn't provide the other spouse or children with suitable support.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case of desertion or abandonment.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Consent is very important in the eyes of the law</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key here is consent of the proposed witness. In Michigan, if a spouse agrees to testify, then </span><b>they can appear in court and share private information about the spouse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, if they don't give consent, then the law says they can't be forced to give testimony. Unless of course the situation happens to be one of those specifically mentioned as exceptions by Michigan law.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Spousal privilege doesn't apply to other people beyond your spouse!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is important, because spousal privilege ONLY applies to your spouse, and ONLY in certain situations. If either spouse passes on confidential information to someone else, that information isn't considered protected by the spousal privilege law anymore. In other words, </span><b>the third party can be required to testify in court because they are not the individual's spouse</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, if a husband shares information with his wife, and his wife then tells that information to a friend, that friend could be compelled to testify.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Can divorced people be forced to testify against each other?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law states that "</span><b>a married person or a person who has been married previously</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shall not be examined in a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal prosecution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as to any communication made between that person and his or her spouse or former spouse during the marriage without the consent of the person to be examined." In other words, even after you are divorced, you cannot be forced to testify against your ex!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, the law only applies to a legally married couple. If the marriage isn't legal for any reason, the privilege wouldn't apply. It also doesn't apply to couples living together who aren't married, even if they share children and a home. This is because </span><b>Michigan doesn't recognize common law marriage as being a legal type of marriage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
