<h4>A criminal record can be really expensive.</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, having a criminal record will cost you. Money certainly, because you will have incurred attorney's fees along the way (although maybe that's why you ended up with a criminal record - you let the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/court-appointed-attorneys" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public defender</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represent you.) Then there's the fact that while in jail or prison, you can't hold down a job and earn an income. However, the cost of a criminal record goes far beyond the issue of money.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to money and a viable income, a criminal record also costs you relationships, the ability to get a good job and respectability in your community. That's still not all. In addition to all of the intangible ways that having a criminal record will cost you, there are also the many rights you will lose as a result. Both state and federal laws are very specific about the fact that convicted felons may not do, participate in, or own certain things. </span>

&nbsp;
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of your potential losses looks like this:</span></h4>
<h3><b>The Right to Bear Arms:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both federal and Michigan law says that a convicted felon may not legally own or possess a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun or firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any kind. In addition, Michigan law also forbids a convicted felon from getting a concealed carry permit. There are some provisions in Michigan law that might allow you to restore your gun rights after a lengthy waiting period. You can read about that at </span><a href="http://www.restoremygunrights.info" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.RestoreMyGunRights.info</span></a>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>The Right to Serve on a Jury:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan state law does not allow anyone who has been convicted of a felony to serve on a jury in a Michigan court.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>The Right to Join the Military:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been convicted of a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony in Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, regardless of how long ago the crime took place, or what it was that you did, you are forbidden from serving in the military. This includes all branches of the armed forces: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard. This also includes the National Guard.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>The Right to own a Michigan Liquor License: </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Convicted felons in Michigan are not allowed by law to own a liquor license. This means that you would not be able to own or operate a bar or restaurant that serves </span><a href="http://www.windrunkdriving.com/michigan-drunk-driving-misdemeanors.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liquor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This does not mean, however, that you can't work as a waitress or waiter or a bartender in one of these establishments.  Only the owner is required to have a Michigan liquor license.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>The Right to own a Gaming (Casino) license:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of jobs that a person can get at a casino here in Michigan, requires that you have a license from the Michigan Gaming Commission. For those who have been convicted of a felony here in Michigan, you are immediately disqualified from receiving this </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>The Right to Habitual Offender Status:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, if you have been convicted of a felony in the past and you are charged again for another crime, your previous conviction allows the prosecution to charge you as a repeat offender. Being charged as a habitual offender is likely to increase your sentence, with each subsequent offense increasing your possible sentence even more.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of these reasons and more, we urge anyone facing criminal charges to ensure that they get the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best possible defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to represent them. Like many other things in life, you often get what you pay for. Attorneys that work cheap probably have a good idea of what they’re worth. With attorneys, as with dentists and doctors, hire the best one you can afford to hire. These are not good places to be cheap.  </span>
