&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week we spent some time </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-control-michigan-facts-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploring Michigan's gun laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how that impacts the second amendment rights of Michigan's residents. However, laws change regularly. In the wake of recent school shootings, and </span><b>several gun-on-campus scares that have taken place in Michigan </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the last few weeks, Michigan's legislators are considering some different approaches to gun safety in the Great Lakes States.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>'Red Flag' Laws:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who haven't encountered the term 'red flag' laws as they pertain to guns, it refers to laws that would allow the court to </span><b>temporarily remove someone's right to have a gun</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when there are 'red flags' in their behavior or speech. In other words, saying or doing things that lead others to believe that </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone is a danger </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to themselves or to other people.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan’s governor has already spoken out in support of the red flag laws, and he isn't the only one. </span><b>President Trump agreed that red flag laws may help save lives. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since his support was made public, several other states have also begun examining their legislation with an idea towards incorporating red flag laws. Obviously not everyone is in favor.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Arming Teachers:</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea to arm teachers is a somewhat controversial one, and has met with mixed responses from House and Senate members in Michigan. Representative Jim Runestad, chair of Michigan’s House Judiciary Committee, is in favor of the move. </span><b>As the father of a teen daughter,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he says he wants to explore any option that would keep his child safe, should there ever be a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/illegal-discharge-of-a-firearm-in-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shooter situation at her school.</span></a>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But he also has serious reservations. As he pointed out recently, for this to work, teachers would have to be subjected to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy trainings and background checks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Why? Because, as he puts it, "</span><b>There are many teachers I wouldn't trust with a butter knife, let alone a pistol.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" Representative Brian Elder, the husband of a teacher, says that the notion of most teachers choosing to carry guns in school simply isn't a realistic one. Instead, he says that universal background checks for people purchasing guns makes much more sense. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is the right answer for Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, that hasn't been determined yet. Different people are lobbying for what they believe is the best solution to the problem, and we will simply have to wait and see what the final decision is. Many states are in the same position as Michigan, </span><b>struggling to address this controversial issue in a way that takes into account everyone's concerns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while still working to solve the problem. And as you can see, we have a long road ahead of us.</span>
