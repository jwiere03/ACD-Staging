<p dir="ltr">St Patrick's day - for most Americans it's a celebration synonymous with Leprechauns, wearing green and drinking beer.  And not so surprisingly, also bar fights.</p>
Notable among the most recent St Patty's day bar scuffles was one involving the arrest of an Oakland County Sheriff's deputy at O’Malley’s Irish Pub &amp; Restaurant in Hartland Township.

Thomas Knasiak, a deputy with the Highland Township substation, and his codefendant Andrew Coleman, were charged last week Monday, with resisting police, following a 911 call reporting that a man was being assaulted by three other men.

First on the scene was a Michigan State Trooper who attempted to interview the victim of the assault. Next to respond was a Livingston County sheriff’s deputy who was given descriptions of two of the men involved, Knasiak and Coleman, who were at that time walking away from the bar.


<h2>Deputy's commands were ignored</h2>

The Livingston County Deputy followed the men and called out repeatedly that they were to stop, but his commands were ignored. When the Officer attempted to stop the two men, they resisted and were subsequently arrested.  Generally, it is unlawful in Michigan to resist, assault, hinder or hinder an officer carrying out his lawful duty.

Immediately after criminal charges were filed, Knasiak was stripped of his gun and badge and assigned to a non-deputised jail position pending the outcome of the criminal charges and an internal investigation conducted by the Oakland County Sheriff's Office.
<p dir="ltr">Knasiak was arraigned last Wednesday and released on a $8,000, 10 percent surety bond for $800. He then returned to court on Friday for the pretrial conference.</p>
Resisting Arrest is a felony class crime and can carry jail or prison time as a punishment.
