&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for joining us again as we take an indepth look at what you HAVE TO remember if you are ever </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused of a sex crime in Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being accused of a sex crime is a horrific experience. People tend to assume the worst, no matter how highly they think of you. This means that </span><b>relationships may be ruined before you ever get a chance to clear your name</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that the problems you're facing right now feel overwhelming, </span><b>there are some very important things that you need to keep in mind right now!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Saying or doing the wrong thing at the wrong time can end up costing you your future. So take a moment to read through our basic list of what you should know. That way, if you're ever accused of a sex crime in Michigan, you'll be prepared. If you missed the first article in this series, don't fret, <a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/26221.html">it's right here</a>!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Be very careful about what you give your consent to!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings us to the next consent related issue - </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">searches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and samples. While you should consent politely to having your picture and your fingerprints taken during the booking process, you MUST NOT consent to anything else. For example, </span><b>DO NOT give permission for an officer to search your home or your vehicle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or for a medical technician to take samples of your hair or blood. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is common for police to tell you that they will get a warrant if you refuse to consent. That’s fine. Let them apply for a warrant. They may or they may not actually get a warrant. If they do get a warrant, be fully cooperative with the police. If they don’t have a warrant, do not consent to anything. (This advice does not apply to consenting to take a breath test at the police station or jail if you are arrested for drunk driving.) </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Always remember to request your telephone call.</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as you are given access to a phone, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact your attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don't know your attorney's number, call a friend or family member who will call an attorney on your behalf. The sooner an attorney is by your side, ensuring that your rights are being protected and that you're not being manipulated into saying something that will hurt you, the better your chances of surviving this process. </span><b>A good attorney can make ALL THE DIFFERENCE to your case! </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until your criminal defense attorney arrives, lawyer up and shut up. Also remember that phone calls into and out of jails and prisons are being recorded. Watch what you say on the telephone. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Watch what you say in jail and to your loved ones!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be very careful what you say, and who you say it to! Being polite and pleasant to your cell mate is never a bad idea if you want your short stay there to be less stressful. But </span><b>it's critical that you don't discuss your case with </b><b><i>anybody</i></b><b> except your attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your cellmate might seem like a  friendly person, but he or she can become </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a police informant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a matter of minutes. "Jailhouse snitches” have ruined many criminal defense strategies in Michigan. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, your family and friends may mean well but they could inadvertently leak information that could jeopardize your case. We completely understand the urge to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/second-degree-csc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explain what happened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to those who want to support you, but even this is a bad idea. For starters, </span><b>you have no control over who will repeat what.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Also, you don't know how much it will get twisted around as the info travels from person to person. And even loved ones can be forced to testify in court, where they will be required to tell the truth, which may not be in your best interest.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Hire the best possible attorney if you've been arrested!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us next time, as we look at the last three items on our list. Until then, if you need </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a skilled defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with decades of experience, </span><b>call The Kronzek Firm at 866 766 5245</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don't wait to see if this works out in your favor, or do nothing and hope that it will all go away. This is very serious and if you are to survive it, you must treat it as such!</span>
