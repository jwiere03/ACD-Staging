&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In late January of this year, a new program was launched in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/macomb-county-criminal-attorneys-macomb-michigan-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macomb County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that hopes to make a difference to those who are struggling with opiate addiction. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope not Handcuffs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows</span><b> a person battling addiction to walk into a police station and ask for help without fear of reprisal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What's that you say? Walk into a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> station and ask for help with a drug problem and not get locked up? Is this for real? Yes, it is real, at least in Macomb County, Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope not Handcuffs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched on January 31st, 2017. </span><b>Macomb County is the first county in Michigan to implement a program of this kind</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although it is in use in other parts of the country. It works like this:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A person either applies online at the</span> <a href="http://www.familiesagainstnarcotics.org/hopenothandcuffs" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope not Handcuffs</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website, or simply walks into any police station in Macomb County and says that they are seeking help for a drug or alcohol addiction. Immediately </span><b>an "angel" is mobilized to step in and assist them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Angels are a fleet of volunteers in the Detroit area who have been trained to respond when an addict reaches out for help.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Angels arrive at the police stations and </span><b>makes the necessary phone calls to get that person into treatment at a rehab center</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although they aim for rehabs here in Michigan, if the right treatment can't be found locally they will reach out to other states. The angel will sit with the addict, help them fill out the right paperwork, and ensure that they get a bed in a treatment facility that day.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Angels are volunteers who facilitate the process for addicts seeking help.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They also help to sort out insurance issues, and make sure that the process is smooth and straightforward. </span><b>People struggling with drug addiction are usually so overwhelmed, that this assistance is exactly what they need</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are already people who have been helped by this program, many of whom are in rehab here in Michigan, though some were sent out of state to get the help they needed.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is unique, in that it guarantees immunity. A person can show up at a police station, admit that they struggle with abuse of an illegal drug, and even </span><b>turn over their drug paraphernalia, all without any legal repercussions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So a person hoping to overcome </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crack cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use can hand their crack pipe over to an officer and not be arrested. The same goes for a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heroin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addict and their needles, spoons and syringe. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to 41B District Court Judge Linda Davis, this program </span><b>allows addicts to be diverted into treatment before their addiction lands them in a courtroom</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then behind bars. Davis, whose own daughter battled and overcame an opiate addiction, says that she is in favor of anything that keeps kids alive.</span>

We have also seen how harmful incarceration is when all a person needs is treatment. </span><b>We encourage all of our readers to consider making use of this program if they, or a loved one, are struggling with addiction and don't know where to turn for help</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
