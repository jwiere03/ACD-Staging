When applying for any type of employment, an applicant is required to answer various questions before securing the position. If a person is applying for a governmental job requiring serious clearance, it is essential to provide accurate and truthful information. Experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers can attest that failure to do so can result in serious legal troubles and consequences. These circumstances are seen in a recent case where a man is accused of providing false data to federal agents while applying for a job.
<h2>CIA Applicant Falsifies Data and Lands In Hot Water</h2>
According to law enforcement officials, Glenn Shriver, 28, applied for a position working with the Central Intelligence Agency. He believed that his experience working overseas, particularly in Asia, could be beneficial to the prestigious governmental agency. However, he was charged last Thursday after officials stated that during his visit abroad in 2007, Shriver met with Chinese intelligence officers and was compensated $70,000 in cash. Because he either omitted or denied this information during the application process, the suspect Shriver was arrested on Michigan criminal charges of lying to federal agents--a felony in the United States with a maximum sentence of five years in jail.

According to his mother, Karen Chavez, her son traveled to China for work, but left after an outbreak of SARS. Shriver then came back to the United States before accepting a position teaching English in South Korea, prior to applying for a position with the CIA. He was arrested at Detroit Metro Airport trying to travel back overseas.

Despite the allegations against him, Shriver has no previous criminal history.

Being suspected of making false statements to a federal agent is a serious accusation. As seen by the case of Glenn Shriver, it is possible to be charged criminally, resulting in the forfeiture of beloved rights and liberties. Not only will conviction affect the livelihood of the defendant, but also will almost certainly result in jail time. If accused, it is important to be pro-active in securing the best defense for your case.
