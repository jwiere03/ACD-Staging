<span style="font-weight: 400;">An officer of the law covering up murder seems more the province of Hollywood, not Detroit. And yet Elijah Lately, a 25-year-old Detroit Police Officer, is facing allegations that he concealed a murder from investigators. In essence, that he knew about a planned murder, and did nothing to stop it, and then lied about it afterwards. </span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an indictment that was unsealed on Monday in the Wayne County Circuit Court, Lately was apparently indicted by a grand jury consisting of a single person. According to the prosecution, the events that led to the indictment happened as follows…</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandon Rice was a witness for the prosecution in an ongoing case. He had been shot by the same man who had formerly shot three members of his family in 2013 - Dmarco Hoskins. Because Rice's testimony was very damaging to the defense, Hoskins decided that the best course of action was to eliminate the threat. Rice had to die.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is where it gets complicated. If the prosecution is to be believed, Lately knew about the plan to kill Rice, and not only kept his silence, but actively interfered with the subsequent investigation into Rice's murder.</span>

<h2>He denied any knowledge of Rice’s planned murder</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately was then identified as a potential witness in Rice's murder by investigators. He was interviewed by both Detroit Police Homicide detectives, and by the Michigan State Police Detectives. But he denied any knowledge of Rice's planned murder.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dmarco Hoskins has since been charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and witness intimidation. If convicted, he is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison. Lately, who is also facing charges, is facing two counts of lying to a police officer during a violent crime investigation. Under Michigan law, this is a four year felony.</span>

Since the charges have been formally brought, Lately has been arrested and given a bond of $400,000. He has also been suspended without pay from his position on the Detroit Police force, and an investigation has been opened by the Detroit Police Department's homicide task force and integrity unit, a section of the Internal Affairs Section.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is not currently any information available on the date and time of Lately's next court date. However, we will keep you updated as the investigation and hearings move forward.</span>
