At The Kronzek Firm, we hear from many people who have been charged with <a title="Michigan Drug Crime Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html">drug crimes</a>. Common charges include <a title="Michigan Marijuana Lawyers" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html">Marijuana possession</a> and Marijuana manufacture and delivery. However, a new trend in Michigan is synthetic cannabis. This is a chemical similar to the high-inducing chemical in weed. Fake pot used to be legal, but Michigan and federal legislators are now cracking down on synthetic marijuana substances like Spice, K-2, and LOL.


<h2>It is a stimulating psychoactive drug</h2>

Another new trend in Michigan is a drug called “bath salts.” This is not the same as the smelling salts one adds to a bubble bath, but it is marketed as such to get around federal and state drug laws. Technically, this substance is called Methylenedioxypyrovalerone, or MDPV for short. It is a stimulating psychoactive drug. Recently, the Drug Enforcement Agency used its emergency scheduling powers to make bath salts illegal.

Substances like synthetic cannabis and bath salts are considered <a title="Michigan Drug Crime Lawyers" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html">designer drugs</a>, which are drugs with a chemical makeup similar, but not identical to, an illegal controlled substance. However, as is the case with things like K-2, state and federal laws now prohibit the use, possession, and manufacture of certain designer drugs, also called analogue drugs.

Regardless of which drug crime a person is charged with, the penalties can be severe. It is important to contact a drug crime defense lawyer immediately if you are being investigated for or have been charged with a drug crime.
