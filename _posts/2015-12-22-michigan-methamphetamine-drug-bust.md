<h2><b>Troopers Find 7 Pounds of Crystal Meth</b></h2>
It was a chilly Wednesday afternoon in mid-December, when Michigan State Troopers pulled over a vehicle in Hartford Township, Van Buren County. The car, sporting Colorado plates, had a cracked windshield and was traveling below the posted speed limit on I-94.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When officers confronted the driver, 49-year-old George Joseph Yellowboy from Nebraska, they began to suspect that he may be under the influence of drugs. For one, he had no idea where he was. Although he was traveling from Colorado to Detroit, Yellowboy told troopers that he thought he was in Indiana.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellowboy gave officers permission to search his vehicle, which revealed seven pounds of pure, unadulterated crystal meth inside a sealed cardboard box. This, according to police, is the largest drug seizure resulting from a routine traffic stop that western Michigan has ever seen. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In follow up interviews with police, Yellowboy admitted to working with a drug trafficking group based in Nogales, Mexico. The organization he works for, according to Yellowboy's police interview, transports drugs from Mexico to locations throughout the northeastern United States.</span>

Yellowboy was arraigned in the Van Buren County District Court, and charged with possession with intent to deliver methamphetamines. Â His bond was set at $2.5 million, and he is currently being held in the Van Buren County Jail.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, possession with intent to deliver <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">methamphetamine</a> is a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison and possible fines of up to $25,000. Meth is a schedule 2 drug according to state law and, as a result, carries very harsh penalties for those who are convicted of making or selling it.</span>
