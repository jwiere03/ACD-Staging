Once convicted of criminal charges, a person’s life will change permanently. If involved in any other altercation, the ex-con automatically becomes a prime suspect because of prior criminal history. Experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers see examples of this often, as it is not uncommon for an already convicted person to become a repeat offender. Such an example is seen in recent news, as an ex-convict is accused of killing his fiancée, and injuring two others in a bloody attack in Clinton Township.

In the evening hours of May 15th, law enforcement officials responded to a report of gunshots fired at a local home. When they arrived, it was discovered that two victims had been stabbed and shot, while one was just stabbed and the other just shot. The person suspected to be at-fault is a 37 year-old ex-convict, who is believed to have killed his ex-fiancée Carrie Seils, and her four year-old son Skylar. The suspect is also being held liable for injuries sustained by Seils six year-old daughter Heaven, as well as James Pagano, who was renting a room at the Clinton Township Home.


<h2>Police cited him as being combative and confrontational</h2>

Law enforcement officials caught up with the suspect about ten miles away at a relative’s condominium, after noticing his black Jaguar parked in front. By 9:30 p.m., the Macomb County Sheriff’s Department had the home surrounded, evacuating other tenants of the building before attempted to arrest the suspect. Although the accused killer’s relatives cooperated with police, the suspect did not go as easily.  Police cited him as being combative and confrontational, especially after law enforcement officials found evidence of a weapon inside the home.

Deeper research of the suspect revealed that he had a previous criminal background. Records from the Michigan Department of Corrections showed that the accused killer was previously convicted for stolen property, evading police, and driving while intoxicated.  He was released from jail in December 2008, and was still on probation at the time of the attack. For the suspect’s involvement in this case, he was set to be arraigned on May 17th by the 41B District Court. Although the incident is currently under investigation, detectives believe that a domestic dispute sparked the confrontation and the bloody assault.

Being accused of a criminal charge is a difficult process for anyone to experience regardless of criminal history of background. As seen in this case, repeat offenders often are held to stricter standards and slapped with harsher punishments because they have already been through the correctional system once. Because of the severe nature of criminal charges resulting in death or injury, it is essential for an accused person to be proactive in securing the best defense for their case.
