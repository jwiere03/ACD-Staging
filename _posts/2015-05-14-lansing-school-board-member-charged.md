<h2>Facing Embezzlement and Welfare Fraud Charges</h2>
In January of this year, Nicole Armbruster resigned from her position on the Lansing School Board for "personal family circumstances". But on that same day, the Lansing School District reported to the police irregularities in the Lewton Elementary Parent Teacher Organization fund. Because Armbruster had been their former vice-president, police began scrutinizing her activities.<!--more-->

By early March, the investigation had turned up enough evidence. Authorities were certain of what had taken place. Armbruster was charged with embezzling over $3,800 from the Lewton PTA. Police say they can prove that she cashed a $950 check, money from the school's PTA fund, on October 3rd. In addition, they also have evidence to prove that between October 15th and November 18th, the Lansing School Board member deposited $2,900 of the PTA's money into her personal account.

But that was only the beginning. Prompted by the media coverage of Armbruster's alleged fraud, DHS launched an investigation too. DHS wanted to make certain that they were not targets of fraud as well.

And if the evidence is to be believed, DHS had valid cause for concern. Apparently Armbruster claimed on her DHS paperwork to be separated from her husband. She also didn't claim his income during that period. As a result, the Lansing School Board member collected approximately $4,000 in welfare benefits to which she was not entitled.

Armbruster is facing one felony count of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-racketeering-attorneys-continuing-criminal-enterprise-rico-lawyers" target="_blank">welfare fraud</a> over $500, and one felony count of welfare fraud failing to inform greater than $500. Due to a credit card fraud conviction from back in 2001, Armbruster is being charged as a habitual offender. She has already been bound over for trial. If convicted, she may spend up to eight years in prison.

Armbruster also chose to waive her preliminary hearing in the PTA embezzlement charges case. She is facing a total of seven felonies in this specific case, including six counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-uttering-publishing-attorneys-financial-crimes-lawyers" target="_blank">uttering and publishing</a> for forging signatures on checks. If convicted, she could spend up to 14 years behind bars and be expected to pay a fine of up to $10,000, or three times the amount of the embezzled funds.

No dates have been set for Armbruster's trials in either case. We will keep you informed of updates to this case as it progresses.
