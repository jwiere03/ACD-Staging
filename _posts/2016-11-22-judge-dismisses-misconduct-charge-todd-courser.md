&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been following the case of Michigan House Representatives Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat since it first became public knowledge. </span><b>In addition to the scandal that erupted around their illicit affair, there was the fallout from Courser's botched attempts to mislead the public by forcing an aide to release falsified emails. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led directly to criminal charges of Misconduct in Office.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, it has been a trying time for the pair. </span><b>Gamrat's marriage fell apart as a result of the scandal, and she then chose to resign from the House rather than be fired.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since then, both were charged with Misconduct in Office, although the charges against Gamrat were later dismissed by </span><a href="http://www.lansingmi.gov/150/54-A-District-Court" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lansingâ€™s 54A District Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Judge Hugh Clarke Jr. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Courser was charged with three counts of Misconduct in Office and a single count of Perjury.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Although two of the three charges against Courser were also dismissed in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/ingham-county-criminal-attorney-lansing-michigan-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingham County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Attorney General's Office simply </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-attorney-general-refiles-felony-charges-against-todd-courser.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refiled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them again in a different county - this time in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lapeer-county-criminal-defense-attorneys-michigan.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lapeer County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, there have been additional developments in the case. In addition to both Courser and Gamrat </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/courser-gamrat-file-lawsuits-michigan-attorney-general.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the Michigan Attorney General's Office, a judge has once again chosen to dismiss the final misconduct charge against Courser in Ingham County. </span><b>He is still facing a perjury charge in the Ingham County Circuit Court, and a single count of Misconduct in Office in Lapeer County, Michigan.</b>

&nbsp;
<h2>Third Misconduct Now Charge Formally Dismissed</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Court records show that Judge William Collette dismissed the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misconduct in Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charge on Thursday, November 17, 2016. This was not well received by the prosecutor's office. In a statement made to the public by Andrea Bitely, spokeswoman for the AG's office, she said that "</span><b>We are disappointed that the count of misconduct in office was dismissed, but we will move forward with the charges of perjury and the case in Lapeer County</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is now the third dismissal of charges against Courser. If the Attorney General's Office hadn't chosen to refile the single Misconduct in Office charge against him in Lapeer County, Courser would only be facing a single count of Perjury. However, p</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-perjury-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">erjury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is still a very serious charge. </span><b>Under Michigan law, Perjury is a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Courser's defense attorney has already filed motions requesting that the single charge in Lapeer County be dismissed, although thus far the court hasn't agreed. A</span><b>s of now, due to the most recent dismissal, the trial date for Courser's perjury charge has been set back</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from November 28th, which was the original scheduled date. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal process is a long one. People don't realize how complex and time consuming a criminal case can be. </span><b>Charges, especially when there are several of them and the case is contentious, can take months, if not years, to move through the legal system.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For this reason, it is critical to have an experienced and aggressive criminal defense attorney on your side. One who is up to date on the law, and understands how best to construct a creative and solid defense.
