<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Under the Second Amendment, American citizens are allowed to keep and bear arms for personal protection. Michigan state law also has its own provisions regarding gun use, as well as locations where firearms are not allowed. Nonetheless, any criminal defense lawyer in Michigan could testify that this topic is a heated one, often brought up during the planning of festivals or events that draw large crowds.</span>

Among the most recent examples is the Arts, Beats, and Eats festival, the largest in Oakland County.Â  Taking place in downtown Royal Oak, vendors will line the sidewalk for live music, art shows, and food tasting. While this event is certain to be fun for all, many citizens are concerned that their rights regarding gun use will be violated. Some, like Mary Mataczynski of Warren, believe that bringing firearms to the festival is both intimidating and inappropriate. "I'm nervous...with all of these guys carrying guns. Just because it's the law... There's a time and place: It's just not where guns belong," she explained.

Although the city of Royal Oak made an agreement with festival vendors banning firearms from the event, many gun advocates say they still have the right to carry weapons to the event. Under Michigan state law, any person aged 18 and older without prior criminal conviction can openly carry a gun in most locations. The rule prohibits firearms from being carried in banks, churches, court rooms, sports arenas, theaters, day cares, federal buildings, or liquor stores.

<h2>Preventing firearms from being at the event is insulting</h2>

As this list does not include county festivals, groups such as Michigan Open Carry maintain they can keep their guns with them. Auburn Hills resident and Open Carry member Dan Meadows explained that preventing firearms from being at the event is insulting to both veterans and their personal rights. Meadows stated: "It's a deep insult and disrespect for our veterans (not to allow open carry at the festival). Join us in demanding that your basic rights are protected."

While a decision is likely to be announced next week, the debate regarding appropriate gun use in the state continues. Even though firearms are banned from select locations, Americans have the right to keep and bear arms under the Constitution. If your rights to own and carry a gun have been violated, it is essential to have superior legal assistance on your side.
