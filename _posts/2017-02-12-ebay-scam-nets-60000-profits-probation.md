&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">37-year old Travis Winters has spent the last 17 years working at the Standard Electric Company in Kochville Township. However, according to </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/saginaw-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saginaw County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">'s Chief Assistant Prosecutor, about </span><b>a third of those years were also spent scamming the company</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which resulted in a small fortune for Winters.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Court documents show that Winters began stealing an assortment of electronic parts from his employer about five and a half years ago, and selling them on </span><a href="http://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, </span><b>his boss eventually noticed that things weren't adding up in the inventory department</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and hired someone to look over the company's books.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigator narrowed the problem down to Winters. Police were notified, and an investigation was opened. Officers later discovered that Winters had been selling the stolen items on Ebay for profit.  Over the course of several years, from about January 1st, 2010 to July 2015, </span><b>he managed to collect approximately $60,000 in illicit profits.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the end, the result was criminal charges. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Embezzling is a very serious crime in Michigan</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In December of 2016 </span><b>Winters pleaded guilty to a single felony count</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $50,000 to $100,000. Under Michigan law this is a </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and/or a fine up to $25,000.00, or 3 times the value of that which was stolen (whichever is the greater amount), or both. However, in this case Winters was very lucky.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Judge ordered that he repay Standard Electric Company in full, which his attorney says that he has already done. In addition, he was ordered to serve two years of </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and be placed on an electronic tether. Surprisingly, </span><b>he was not required to spend even a single day in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a crime that usually results in at least a decade behind bars.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we do not have all of the details of this case, we can point out that getting an experienced defense attorney will make a huge difference to how your case is handled. </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are often punished quite harshly in Michigan, and </span><b>making sure that you have a skillful lawyer can go a long way towards protecting your future</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial crimes, including </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail Fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-extortion-defense-attorney.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extortion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-insurance-fraud-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance Fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-tax-evasion-attorneys-failure-to-pay.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Evasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rarely result in prison-free sentences in Michigan. For this reason, </span><b>aggressive legal representation is critical in financial crime cases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under usual circumstances, even a misdemeanor embezzlement conviction can result in jail time, probation, and loss of future employment opportunities.  </span>
