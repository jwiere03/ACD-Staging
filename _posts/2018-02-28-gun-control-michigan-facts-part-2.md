&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thanks for joining us for this discussion on gun rights in Michigan. After the recent school shooting, we know that </span><b>the issue of gun rights are a hot topic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and everyone has got an opinion about how this issue should be handled. But as we pointed out </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-control-michigan-facts-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in our previous article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the "national discussion" can be very confusing for people, as each state has their own laws governing gun control. Those state laws are in addition to the existing federal laws. And that's not taking into account county gun laws, and even certain municipalities which also have their own gun ordinances.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you have questions about gun laws, and you live in Michigan, then this series is for you. We hope to be able to </span><b>answer some of the more common questions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and clear up a few misconceptions here. Previously, we discussed </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and schools. Moving forward, we're going to talk about who can buy and own guns in Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Who is allowed to buy a gun in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a video making the rounds - again - on social media about </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB7MwvqCtlk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 13-year-old boy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who tries to buy cigarettes, alcohol and lottery tickets from different stores and is turned down by each one. However, when he tries to buy a gun </span><b>he walks out 20 minutes later with a rifle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It's a poignant reminder of how easy it can be to acquire a gun in some states. But does this apply to Michigan?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, you need to be at least 18 years old to buy a pistol with a purchase license from a private seller. In order to buy a firearm directly from a federally licensed dealer, you need to be 21 years of age. </span><b>You don't need a purchase license to buy a long gun </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">- which has a barrel of 26 inches or longer - in Michigan, but you do need to be at least 18 years of age. Unless of course, you are </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restricted because of your criminal history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your mental health, or any other disqualifying factor.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>'Open carry' is legal in Michigan!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Open carry" is sometimes for confusing for people who </span><b>don't understand what it means</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Have you ever wondered what open carry means, or how it could affect your gun ownership? Let's clear it up…</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Open carry means that </span><b>you may carry a gun with you or on your person</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as long as you are legally allowed to have it, your reason for carrying it is legal, and you are not hiding it. In other words, if you have a gun but it's under your coat or in your pocket, you are breaking the law because that would constitute "concealed carry."</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Is 'concealed carry' also legal in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying a concealed weapon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is legal in Michigan if you have a license for "concealed carry." Concealed carry refers to having </span><b>a gun with you or on your person that is hidden from others</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This could mean in your pocket, under your coat or inside your boot. If you do not have a concealed carry permit, then anytime you have a gun with you, it needs to be visible to others around you.</span>
