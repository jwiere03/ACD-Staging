&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thanks for joining us again here at The Kronzek Firm. In our previous article on juror misconduct we talked about consulting company </span><a href="https://www.doar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOAR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">'s</span><b> revolutionary new study into juror misconduct</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and what jurors had anonymously admitted to doing during trials. This included all manner of court rule violations like researching information online, discussing the details with other jurors, and talking to friends and family about the case. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While these results are staggering in their scope, dwarfing any previous data collected on the subject, they also raise the issue of how we should proceed now. When you think about it, the fact that more than half of the jurors out there admit (anonymously) to violating the judge’s instructions to the jury when it comes of </span><b>researching, sharing and discussion information about the trial</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they are involved in, the implications are massive. The impact on how attorneys handle cases moving forward is significant, and it should also be taken into consideration by the court itself for future trials.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the researchers at DOAR, a legal consulting firm, these results line up with what they already suspected - the fact that jurors are </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/probation-violations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly violating the court’s instructions to them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even when they're specifically instructed by a judge not to. So the question now, is how does one prevent this? Although DOAR doesn't claim to have all of the answers, they do ask </span><b>some very intelligent questions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at getting the legal community thinking.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the points they make is about demographics. The fact that research now shows that college educated non-white males are the most likely to engage in juror misconduct. However, in order to properly address the issue, </span><b>one must understand why it's happening</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Why are these particular people doing so much internet research about the trials they are viewing. The answer is lack of understanding. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurors claim that the primary reason they do online research is to have a better understanding about the laws. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many jurors said that they didn't understand the law as it was explained to them in court, and so they </span><b>felt compelled to go online and find more and better information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With that in mind, are there things the court could do differently to reduce this issue in future? One suggestion made by DOAR is that the court do a better job of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explaining the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it pertains to the case in question, right at the beginning.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the researchers, "When jurors are not given instructions on the law or definitions of the elements of the alleged crimes until the very end of the trial, it is no wonder they feel as though they need to go elsewhere to investigate for themselves." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another point they make is that attorneys need to be aware of this fact, and take it into account when preparing for a trial. Specifically, they advise attorneys to consider the ways in which </span><b>online information could impact their trial</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then adjust their strategy accordingly. By assuming right from the get-go that jurors will be accessing the internet for additional info on the case, an attorney can make adjustments to their presentation and angle.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, this is a very interesting subject that has some very important implications for attorneys, defendants, judges and everyone else involved in our Michigan legal system. If you consider the facts for a few moments you will realize that </span><b>the ramifications of such rampant juror misconduct</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> probably has ramifications for everyone everywhere. We are all impacted by the way our society's legal system operates, and all of us are, directly or indirectly, impacted by the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/hyta-sentencing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people who are incarcerated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based solely on the decision of a jury. Or set free.</span>

&nbsp;
