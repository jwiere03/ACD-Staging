Dr. Kevorkian is well-known in Michigan and in the rest of the United States for spearheading the movement towards assisted suicide. Kevorkian, also known as “Dr. Death,” claims to have helped around 130 people end their lives.

Before Kevorkian’s death, he had been hospitalized for kidney and heart problems at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. He died at 2:30 a.m. on Friday, June 3, 2011. The attorneys at The Kronzek Firm PLC extend our condolences to his family and friends.


<h2>Kevorkian won against Michigan prosecutors four times</h2>

In the 1990s, Dr. Kevorkian’s assisted suicide practice led to multiple <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">homicide</a> charges against him. He won against Michigan prosecutors four times before his 1999 second-degree murder conviction. He spent 8 years in prison and was released on parole in 2007. After his conviction, Oregon legalized some cases of assisted suicide.
