<h2>Washtenaw Dangerous WeaponÂ Assault</h2>
While the average police officer is threatened with a wide variety of weaponry during the course of his or her career, it has been many generations since swordplay was common on the streets of a city in Michigan.

But that's exactly what two officers on patrol in Ann Arbor encountered late on Saturday evening. According to Ann Arbor police Detective Lt. Robert Pfannes, the two officers came upon a fight in progress at the intersection of Traver and Pear Streets.<!--more-->

Three men were apparently involved in the altercation, one of whom was armed with a sword and had it lifted it over his head ready to strike when the officers arrived. The two officers immediately shined their patrol vehicle's spotlight on him, trained their guns on him, and ordered him to drop the sword.

But the angry swordsman refused to comply, rushing instead at the officers and stopping a short distance away. The officers placed him under arrest, although he struggled with them, and attempted to dispose of drug paraphernalia that had been on his person, including a crack pipe.

One of the other men involved in the sword fight told the officers that he knew the man, and that his name was Adam Lee Harris. Apparently the victim was walking on Traver street, when he ran into Harris, who then spouted off at him in "gibberish" talk, and then shoved him. He claims that he shoved Harris in return, at which point Harris pulled out a twenty-inch sword and began to swing it.

Harris was subsequently charged with two felonies, namely: <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-assault-dangerous-weapon-attorneys.html" target="_blank">assault with a dangerous weapon</a> and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-resisting-obstructing-attorneys-resisting-arrest-assaulting-police-lawyers.html" target="_blank">assaulting, resisting or obstructing a police officer</a>. He is being held at the Washtenaw County Jail on a $2,500 cash or surety bond.

Harris' preliminary exam hearing is scheduled for October 9th at 8:30 am in the 14A-1 District Court in Pittsfield Township.
