<h2>Virgil Smith Charged after Shooting Ex-Wife's Car</h2>
As if politicians don't get enough bad press already, Michigan State Senator Virgil Smith is facing a number of felony charges after police say he shot up his ex-wife's car after an argument. The media has had a field day with this particular event, as Smith was an outspoken supporter of gun control.<!--more-->

According to police, the incident began when Smith's ex-wife, Anita Thomas, forced her way into his home just before 1 am. She apparently arrived at the property and began banging on his bedroom window and when he opened the door, she pushed past him into the house.

Angered by the fact that he was with another woman, Thomas apparently attacked the woman, and Smith attempted to restrain her. They wrestled and fought and knocked over a TV. Senator Smith then told her to leave the property, and went to check on his bed partner. When he returned to the front of the house he found Thomas throwing a chair through his front window.

Smith, who was stark naked at the time, responded by going out into his driveway where Thomas had parked her Mercedes Benz, and firing at it repeatedly with his gun. Police specified that Thomas was not injured in the incident, only her vehicle was damaged. Police say that 10 shots hit the car in total.

According to Detroit Police Chief James Craig, Smith was arrested at his home and held at the Detroit Detention Center until he posted bail. After the arrest, police searched the Senator's home and discovered a rifle and a rifle cleaning kit, along with ammunition.

Since his arrest, Virgil Smith has been charged with domestic assault, felony firearm and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers" target="_blank">felonious assault with a dangerous weapon</a>, in addition to malicious destruction of property. For those who are familiar with Senator Smith's history however, this may come as no surprise.

The Senator's criminal history includes multiple drunk driving charges in 2004, two separate shoplifting instances in 2002, and retail fraud charges in 2001. Senator Smith is scheduled to be back in court tomorrow, Â May 22nd.

It remains to be seen how this affects his political career.
