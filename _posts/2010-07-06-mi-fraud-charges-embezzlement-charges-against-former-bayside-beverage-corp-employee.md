Years of experience as criminal defense lawyers in Michigan has certainly proven one thing: a person can be subject to an accusation of criminal charges anywhere, including the work place. An individual is still held responsible for the behavior they exhibit while on the job. As the economy continues its slow recovery, it seems that examples of employees taking cash from their employers are on the rise. Accusations of fraud charges will have negative and life-changing consequences, including a loss of employment and even jail time.

Such a case is seen in the recent example of a Boyne City man, who was arrested by state police for <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank">embezzlement charges in Michigan,</a> unlawfully taking over $69,000 from his former employer.

<h2>Earlier this year he was fired for unrelated reasons</h2>

For some time, Michael Fish, 46, was the controller of the Bayside Beverage Corporation and was responsible for handling the corporation's finances.  Earlier this year he was fired for unrelated reasons. However, when the new interim controller and new owner tried to analyze the company's finances, they discovered that Fish had been taking money from Bayside Beverage Corporation. According to an affidavit from the 90th District Court, Fish was "exploiting the company's accounting software to write checks to himself, or for his own benefit, and expensing the amounts of various checks to various vendor accounts."

From March 2008 to January 2010, Fish is alleged to have written almost 50 checks to himself, adding up to $64,005.02. In addition, a few other checks were discovered written to Home Depot by the suspect, totaling $3, 236.75. Each of the checks in question were both written and endorsed by Fish. Additionally, an investigation conducted by Michigan State Police confirmed that many of these checks were deposited directly into the former employee's bank account.

After arrest, police brought Fish to the Emmet County Jail.  He was eventually released after posting a $5,000 bond.  However, the former company controller is due to appear in court this week, likely to be charged with a felony count of embezzlement, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.

As seen by the example of Michael Fish, being suspected of fraud charges in Michigan is a big deal, especially in the work place. If convicted, he will likely be forced to repay all the money and could spend up to 15 years behind bars. Because the possible punishments are so serious, it is important for the accused to be pro-active in securing the best legal defense.  Seeking the assistance of experienced <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">criminal defense attorneys in Michigan</a> can provide top-notch legal advice and legal representation, designed to keep you at work and out of jail.
