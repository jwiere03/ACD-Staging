<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back, and thanks for joining us here at The Kronzek Firm for a discussion about fraud crimes in Michigan. In <a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fraud-crimes-michigan-need-know-credit-card-fraud.html">our introductory article</a> we broke down credit card fraud for our readers. We discussed what it involved, </span><b>what a prosecutor would have to prove</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to secure a criminal conviction, and what the penalties are under Michigan law. Moving on, we'll be talking about embezzlement, and what that charge and conviction looks like for residents of Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is embezzlement?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement happens when an employee steals funds from their employer, or from the organization where they work. This crime has very specific parameters. In order for a financial theft to count as </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embezzlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the accused has to be </span><b>employed at the place they took the money from</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they had to have had legal access to the funds.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a Detroit accountant who "siphons a little off the top" is a classic example of embezzlement. Another example would be a secretary in Lansing who removes petty cash for personal purchases, like manicures and clothing. The money was taken from their place of employment, and it was </span><b>money they had legal access to</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but weren't allowed to take or use personally. A slightly different examples involves the volunteer treasurer of the Girl Scout troop that steals money from the organization because they had legal access to those funds. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>How is embezzlement discovered?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement is usually discovered due to an irregularity in the bookkeeping or accounting of a business or organization. It may be missing money, or funds redirected to unauthorized accounts. Sometimes it will be </span><b>unauthorized purchases made with company funds</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even transactions that don't make sense. Whatever it is that trips the alarm, so to speak, once an investigation is started, it isn't unusual for numerous irregularities to be revealed.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are the penalties for embezzlement?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to embezzlement, the amount stolen has a direct impact on the penalty. The larger the sum, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the greater the penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Keep in mind that having </span><b>prior convictions will also increase the penalties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for fraud crimes. In Michigan, it looks like this:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than $200 is a misdemeanor. The penalty is up to 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200.00 through $1,000.00 is a misdemeanor. The penalty is up to 1 year imprisonment, a fine up to $2,000.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,000.00 through $20,000.00 is a felony. The penalty is up to 5 years in prison, a fine up to $10,000.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$20,000.00 through $50,000.00 is a felony. The penalty is up to 10 years in prison, a fine up to $15,000.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50,000.00 through $100,000.00 is a felony. The penalty is up to 15 years in prison, a fine up to $25,000.00, 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100,000 and anything larger is a felony. The penalty is up to 20 years, a fine up to $50,000.00, or 3 times the value, whichever is greater, or both.</span></li>
</ul>
