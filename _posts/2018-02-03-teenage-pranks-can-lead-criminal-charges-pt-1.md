&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time when teen pranks didn't get any worse than crank calls and the occasional house egging (not that washing hardened egg off your exterior walls isn't a giant pain in the rear!) But </span><b>times have changed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The shenanigans that teens get up to these days have escalated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">considerably </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in recent decades (not always for the better), and the result is sometimes </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/hyta-sentencing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Some of the changes are not the pranks, just the public's reaction to them!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time when egging windows and toilet papering houses was seen as annoying and disrespectful. But not criminal! That has changed, though. The "kids will be kids" mindset has changed, and Michigan </span><b>teens are now expected to know better</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What was once seen as harmless pranking, is now seen as criminal behavior, and can result in some very serious charges (and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/restitution.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court-ordered restitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments!)</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think toilet papering someone's home might be fun? Think again. Anything that damages or defaces property (either public or private) is illegal. As a group of Texas Teens and one mom learned the hard way! Taura Mauney took her 16-year-old daughter and a group of her friends "TPing" around their neighborhood. However </span><b>one of the toilet papering victims called the cops</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Mauney, along with the kids, ended up facing vandalism and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Destruction of Private Property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charges!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Online access has changed the way teens prank in recent years!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet access and social media has revolutionized the way teens prank nowadays. Not just because </span><b>the internet is a treasure trove of inappropriate ideas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but because sharing everything on </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/computer-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media gets attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Teens whose pranks go viral have their behavior reinforced because the action, however wrong, earns them attention and a brief fan-club online.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the prank involves a computer though, the charges can be very serious! A Florida teen </span><b>hacked into his school's network </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and changed one teacher's background picture to an image of two gay people kissing, the reaction was more than he bargained for. Instead of annoying one teacher and getting a few laughs from classmates, he ended up facing </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-of-a-computer-to-commit-a-crime-in-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony cybercrime charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Michigan teens are at risk of facing criminal charges for pranking!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the cases we've shared with you so far have been from other states, this is an issue right here in Michigan too! Teens right here in the Great Lakes State are no different from teens all over the country. They're impulsive, </span><b>they don't always think through the consequences of their actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and sometimes they make very bad choices! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Kronzek Firm, we understand that, as parents, </span><b>you cannot always control your teen's actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even be aware of everything they do, despite your best efforts. However, once they've done something thoughtless and landed themselves in the hot seat, we know that as parents </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/about-us.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you want to help them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and protect their futures.
