As the economy remains slow to recover, people continue to be very concerned with money. Because budgets are tight, businesses are keeping a closer eye on their funding to ensure that all their income is accounted for. Although it might be tempting for an employee to "borrow" or take funds from an organization, the consequences for doing so are severe. Experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers can verify, being accused of any fraud charges will not only affect your livelihood, but could put you behind bars. Circumstances like this were seen in a recent case, where a former employee of the University of Michigan has been arrested for embezzling money from the school.

From September 1990 to March 2010, Ypsilanti resident Donald Sims Jr., 41, worked as a business administrator for the U of M's Center for Afro-American and African Studies. One of his responsibilities was to purchase equipment for the department, which is a sub-unit of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Despite his long-standing employment with the esteemed school, Sims has been accused of using his close proximity to university cash for personal gain. As a result, University of Michigan police officers arrested him earlier this month on Michigan fraudÂ and <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-embezzlement-attorney-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank">embezzlement</a> charges.

<h2>Sims fraudulently purchased and sold computer items</h2>

According to law enforcement officials, Sims began his criminal activity in January 2008, ending it in February 2010, right before his employment with the school ended. He is accused of "fraudulently purchasing" over 75 computers and 14 computer-related items, worth $74,000. Even though this was a part of his position, the university and police believe that he sold the equipment to make extra cash for himself. Additionally, Sims supposedly used a University of Michigan credit card to spend approximately $14,000 on other fraudulent purchases, for which the school was never reimbursed.

A pretrial for the former business administrator is set to occur on July 22nd regarding the aforementioned Michigan felony charges. Court documents show that if he is convicted, Sims could spend up to 30 years in prison.

As shown by the example of Donald Sims Jr., being accused of fraud or embezzlement is a difficult experience for anyone to go through, with life-changing consequences. A guilty verdict could result in the loss of job, fines, and a lengthy jail sentence. Because the punishments are so severe, it is essential to pro-actively seek the best legal defense for your case.
