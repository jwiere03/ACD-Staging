Being confronted and questioned by law enforcement officials can be an intimidating and scary experience for anyone to go through, particularly when one is suspected of committing a crime. Although people in the United States are considered innocent until proven guilty, probing and unrelenting interrogation by police without the presence of a top criminal lawyer is very risky for a defendant--statements or decisions can be made that will negatively impact any criminal case against them. Unfortunately, it is this type of situation that often results in innocent people being sent to jail or prison, being held accountable for crimes they did not commit.

Such is the recent example of Mark Craighead, who was arrested in June 2000 in connection with the three year-old murder case of his closest friend, Chole Pruett. Detectives interrogated Craighead regarding the case, prodding him to admit guilt for the crime. In the end, he signed a vaguely worded statement ultimately undermining his alibi; he claimed that he was working the midnight shift at a local Sam's Club when the murder occurred. Although Craighead asked law enforcement officials if he could call Michigan defense attorney before questioning, the police refused.
<h2>Proper Legal Representation isÂ Key</h2>
Due to a lack of proper legal representation and his signed confession, Craighead was convicted of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">Michigan murder charges</a>, and served seven years in prison as a result. Today, law students at the University of Michigan are working hard to clear Craighead's name, and believe that they have found evidence proving his innocence. Phone records from the Farmington Hills Sam's Club and AT&amp;T show that Craighead was working on the night of the murder. Additionally, former State Police polygraph examiner John Wojnaroski III also believes in Criaghead's innocence after performing two lie detector tests on him to verify his claims.

Craighead describes the interrogation process as a "nightmare," being subjected to harsh and probative questioning in addition to what he believes to be a pseudo polygraph test he was guaranteed to fail. "He [the examiner] kept telling me I failed and that if I didn't tell the truth, they'd send me up the river for life, and I'd never seen my wife and kids again," Craighead recalls."I trusted police officers. I never thought they'd mess me around like that."

Unfortunately, this is a situation that happens all too often, especially without the presence of the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">best defense attorneys</a> available. When lacking top-notch legal advice and legal representation, an accused individual can be prompted to admit guilt to crimes that they are innocent of. If convicted on the basis of a shady confession, an innocent person could be subjected to extensive prison sentences, high fines, and a permanent scar on their reputation. It is this exact reason that makes it imperative to have an aggressive criminal defense legal team on your side, keeping you at home and not behind bars.
