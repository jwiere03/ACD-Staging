<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Heroin, Crack Cocaine and Prescription Pills Found in Car</span></h2>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">On Tuesday, April 22nd, a tip led police to seek out a drug transaction in Ann Arbor, MI. What transpired was far more extensive and unexpected. After a brief police chase, resulting in a car crash in the middle of a busy intersection, 3 people were arrested, 4 people were hospitalized and a substantial quantity of drugs were seized.</span>

State police Hometown Security Team investigators, working in tandem with LAWNET investigators, apparently received a tip that three known drug dealers would be delivering large amounts of narcotics to Ann Arbor. Officers located the suspects vehicle, a black Nissan Altima, and attempted a routine traffic stop, but the suspects pulled away quickly.

Police chased the suspects for a short distance. The chase ended when the suspects ran a red light and broadsided a car with a Whitmore Lake AIM High School teacher and three students. The teacher and students didn't appear to be hurt, but were taken to the hospital to be checked out.

Immediately after the crash officers surrounded the Nissan with guns drawn. They had been told that the suspects were armed and dangerous. One of the men tried to flee, but was quickly stopped. Investigators searched their car, along with K-9 units from the MSP and the Ann Arbor Police Department. Large quantities of suspected <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank">heroin</a>, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank">crack cocaine </a>and prescription pills were found at the scene.

Of the three men arrested, only two names have been released, Marques Lundy, 26 of Detroit, and Deonte Riley, 25 of Oak Park. The third man is a suspect in a homicide and will be turned over to investigators in the Detroit area.

Lundy is facing seven felony charges, as follows: one count of conspiracy to deliver or manufacturing heroin, four counts of delivery or manufacturing less than 50 grams of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank">heroin</a>, one count of delivery or manufacturing less than 50 grams of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank">cocaine</a> and one count of fourth-degree fleeing and eluding a police officer.

Riley is also facing seven felony charges, namely: one count of conspiracy to deliver or manufacturing heroin, five counts of delivery or manufacturing less than 50 grams of heroin and one count of delivery or manufacturing less than 50 grams of cocaine.

These arrests came as a result of a year long investigation by the Michigan State Policeâ€™s Livingston and Washtenaw Narcotics Enforcement Team. While details were not given, one of the officers said that "This dates back to distribution and selling crack and heroin a year ago!" State police say that both Lundy and Riley have extensive criminal histories which include concealed weapons, cocaine possession, delivery or manufacture of marijuana and stealing a financial transaction device.

Both men were given a $200,000 cash bond and are expected back in court for their preliminary exam at 8:30 a.m. May 1 in the 14A-1 District Court in Pittsfield Township.
