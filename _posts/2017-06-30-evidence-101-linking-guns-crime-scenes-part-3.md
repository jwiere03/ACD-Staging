&nbsp;

Welcome back, and thanks for joining <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan’s premier criminal defense lawyers, The Kronzek Firm, as we wrap up this article series on how investigators links specific guns to crime scenes. In </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/evidence-101-linking-guns-crime-scenes-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our previous articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we looked at the first four items on the list, including </span><b>gunpowder residue, firing pin impressions and bullet trajectory</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moving forward we're going to discuss the last two ways that investigators commonly link a specific weapon to a crime scene. Stick around, you may learn something you didn't know before courtesy of our criminal defense team!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Tissue Damage:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, the tissue we're talking about is the specific cellular matter and material that the human body is made of. In other words, muscle tissue and flesh. When a person is shot, the wound that is created when a bullet enters, and sometimes exits their body, </span><b>can tell investigators a lot about the type of gun it was fired from</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A wound can also provide a lot on information about the distance a bullet was fired from, the sequence of hits, the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/illegal-discharge-of-a-firearm-in-michigan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caliber of the weapon used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the type of bullet, and even the velocity. Even if no bullet is recovered, the wound itself is a font of information.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Examples of this would be: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">External bevelling around the entrance wound, which tells an investigator that the gun barrel was perpendicular to the bone when it was fired. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fracture lines in dense bone, like a skull, can help to identify the distance, velocity and direction of fire. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wounds with blackened, seared skin on the margins reveal a contact shot where the gun was pressed against the body. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grazing bullets leave little flaps of ragged skin which are torn from the body as the bullet passes by at high speed. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exit wounds are usually larger and more ragged than entry wounds.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other examples of how wounds can tell investigators about the weapons and bullets used to create them, lie in the extent of the damage. Centerfire rifles, for example, </span><b>create extensive tissue damage with larger entry points</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while handgun wounds are usually smaller and neater. Wounds are also affected by the type of bullet used. </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full metal jacketed bullets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produce less tissue damage, traveling through the body undamaged, while semijacketed bullets result in the classic "lead snowstorm" appearance on X-rays. This is due to how the bullet jacket peels back as it travels through the body, releasing many small lead fragments</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Fingerprints:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before firing a gun, a person must first load the gun with bullets. This requires </span><b>touching the bullets themselves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And unless the gunman </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans ahead for the crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by wearing gloves, his or her fingerprints will end up on the bullets. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time a person touches a bullet while loading a firearm, they leave miniscule quantities of salty sweat behind. When a bullet is fired away from its casing, the metal of the casing is instantly  exposed to an enormous amount of heat, which vaporizes the moisture left behind, and sets the salts. This happens because the salts become molten, and a chemical reaction that takes place with the metal </span><b>permanently etches the fingerprints into the casing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope this series was helpful to you, and has explained a few of the finer points about how evidence can link specific weapons, and therefore specific people, to crime scenes. Stick around, because we plan to cover aspects of crime scene investigation and evidence collection in the future. Until then, if you or a loved one have been </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged with a gun crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or accused of any other criminal activity in Michigan, contact The Kronzek Firm immediately at 866 766 5245. </span><b>Our experienced defense attorneys have spent decades successfully defending the people of Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against allegations of assault, armed robbery, fraud, arson and sexual assault.
