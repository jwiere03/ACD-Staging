The owner of R.O. Savage Funeral Home in Standish, Michigan, has been charged with felony embezzlement. Richard Weishuhn faces two separate felony charges. The first is for embezzlement of more than $100,000. This is punishable by up to 20-years in prison and possible fines. The second is for embezzlement of more than $50,000, punishable by up to 15-years in prison and possible fines.

The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) conducted a routine audit last year on the records of the funeral home. It was discovered that Weishuhn had failed to submit the required annual financial reports for prepaid funeral contracts from 2006-2012. The audit also found that 174 pre-paid funeral contracts, valued at $601,438, were not held in escrow as required by law.

In addition to the many violations of the Prepaid Funeral and Cemetery Sales Act, it was also discovered that the manager was practicing mortuary science without a license. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs suspended the license and registration of R.O. Savage Funeral Chapel, and ordered that Weishuhn "cease and desist all activity requiring a mortuary science license, including maintaining a funeral establishment and representing himself in connection with a funeral establishment."

LARA reported the alleged misconduct to the Michigan Attorney General's Office, who then conducted their own investigation of Weishuhn's financial affairs. It was revealed that in 2011 and 2012, Weishuhn allegedly spent more than $200,000 in prepaid funeral funds for personal and business use.

Weshuhn turned himself in and was arraigned in 81st District Court in Standish. He was released on a $25,000 bail bond.
