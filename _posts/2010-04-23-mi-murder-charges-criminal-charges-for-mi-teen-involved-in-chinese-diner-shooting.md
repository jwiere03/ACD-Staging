Being accused of any criminal charges in the State of Michigan is a complex process for anyone to go through, especially for minors under the age of 21. Each day, experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers help young adults suspected of some serious violations, including murder. In a recent case seen in the news with similar circumstances, a 19 year-old Michigan man could face life in prison after accused of shooting a man outside a Chinese restaurant.

Last month, Dwayne Williams, 19, allegedly shot Orion Township resident Brian Bailo, 31 as he got out of his Ford pickup truck at the Great Wall Chinese Restaurant. When exiting his vehicle to eat lunch, Williams supposedly confronted him with a gun demanding money. When Bailo refused, the teenager shot him and quickly fled the scene. When law enforcement officials finally arrested Williams on <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">Michigan murder charges</a>, they found on him items taken from Bailo after being shot.

Although the prosecutors insist that the shooting was premeditated, Williams' <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">Michigan criminal lawyer</a> argued to the jury that the teen did not know the gun was loaded. He only meant to scare Bailo, and accidentally pulled the trigger shooting him. Yesterday jurors heard closing arguments in this case, and if Williams' is found guilty, he will almost certainly face life in prison without parole.

Being charged with murder in any state will change your life permanently. Especially for young adults, conviction of criminal charges cannot only ruin your reputation, but will also result in jail time. Because the consequences can be so severe, it is essential to contact hard-working and aggressive Michigan criminal defense attorneys as soon as you at home with your family, instead of behind bars.possible. Acting quickly can ensure the best legal advice, as well as the highest quality legal defense for your case--keeping you at home with your family and not behind bars.
