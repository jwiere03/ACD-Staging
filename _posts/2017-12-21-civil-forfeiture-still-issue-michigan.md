<span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil forfeiture is a subject we've talked about with our readers for years now. It's a highly controversial topic that regularly makes headlines here in Michigan, where we've been labelled one of the worst states for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/new-civil-asset-forfeiture-law-signed-michigans-law.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">civil asset forfeiture regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although in recent years, several laws have passed aimed at better regulation of police seizure of private property, </span><b>Michigan STILL has a problem with civil asset forfeiture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if Attorney General Jeff Sessions makes good on his recent promises, it's probably going to get worse before it gets better!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/msp/2017_Asset_Forfeiture_Report_577873_7.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent state report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one in every ten Michigan residents whose property is seized by the cops is never charged with a crime. That means that 10 percent of all people in Michigan who lose assets to civil forfeiture, are NOT GUILTY of criminal activity. Last year, that 10 percent </span><b>amounted to no less than 523 people</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a staggering number. All of whom lost thousands of dollars in assets. All of whom are presumed to be innocent.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Civil forfeiture in Michigan has a long and sordid history...</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Detroit Free Press recently shared a story about a man from Oakland County in Metro Detroit. His name is Donny Barnes </span><b>and he lost everything in a drug raid</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You hear the term "drug raid" and the automatic assumption is that the man in question must have been </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a drug dealer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Perhaps a producer. If nothing else, at least an illegal user, right? Otherwise, why would the cops raid his home? If only it were that easy….</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2014, heavily armed </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cops busted down Mr. Barnes' door</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and made off with </span><b>his two SUVs, all of his children's Christmas presents, and the contents of his bank account</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - a total of $10,938. It's been just over three years since that day, and although Barnes has never been charged with a crime, he has STILL NOT had his property returned.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>The Barnes case is a classic example of justice being obstructed by "the good guys"...</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent hearing in Pontiac, north of Detroit, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/oakland-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-expert-lawyer-pontiac-farmington-novi-southfield.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakland County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circuit Judge Rae Lee Chabot expressed her fury at how the case has been handled. After hearing that </span><b>the return of Barnes' bank account contents had been once again delayed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she lashed out at the prosecutor. "I’m outraged by the way this was handled!" she told the court, and then went on to accuse the prosecutor's office of deliberate obstruction of justice. "This hints at more than just a mistake." she said, "This continuous action hints at obstruction!"</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been 22 months since the court ruled that Barnes' account should be unfrozen and his assets returned to him. But the prosecutor's office has </span><b>created one delay after another</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dragging their feet and refusing to comply with the court order. In response, Judge Chabot nailed the prosecutor with fines, and awarded $2,500 to the defense in "sanctions."</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Things might be getting better in Michigan, but on a federal level they may still get worse...</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Barnes' case seems to be (slowly) working its way towards a just outcome, the subject of civil asset forfeiture is still being </span><b>hotly debated around the country</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the last few years many states have made an effort to reign the practice in, and now require </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more accountability from officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> confiscating private property. However Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently announced that he fully intends to "develop plans to increase forfeiture."</span>
