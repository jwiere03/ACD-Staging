<h2><b>Tax Fraud Conviction Likely to Result in Prison Time</b></h2>
Happy Asker, the Detroit-based founder of Happy's Pizza, is due in court for sentencing. As a result of having allegedly under-reported income and defrauded the government out of millions of dollars, he has been convicted on a single charge of conspiracy, along with 32 counts of assorted tax crimes.<!--more-->

Asker was convicted in November of conspiracy and tax crimes in a scheme to conceal millions of dollars in income. According to the Internal Revenue Service, this particular <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-tax-evasion-attorneys-failure-to-pay.html" target="_blank">tax fraud scheme</a> has cost the government more than 6 million dollars in lost revenue. But while the prosecutors are requesting a sentence of more than a decade, Asker's attorneys are hoping that Judge Denise Page Hood will take into consideration other options when choosing Asker's sentence.

And they are not alone in that. A mixed bag of people have spoken up on Asker's behalf, including professional athletes, clergymen from around the state and even Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon. According to the priest of St. Fabian Church and School in Farmington Hills, Asker has voluntarily paid for tuition for needy families who couldn't afford to send their children to the Parish's private school.

The issue of how to sentence Asker has caused some consternation for the attorneys and the Judge involved. Asker appeared in court a few days ago for his sentence, but since no conclusion could be reached, the hearing was postponed. There is still a dispute over the money owed to the government, and what sort of sentence is most appropriate.

Asker will face sentencing in federal court soon, where prison is a very likely result. But if his attorneys have their own way, community service will play a part in that as well. A possible example provided was that many students in Detroit area schools could benefit from the wisdom and experience of Asker, who is an entirely self-made man.

It remains to be seen what the Judge finally decides is the best solution to this dilemma, and how she chooses to sentence Asker. We will keep you posted on developments as they arise.
