The Michigan Court of Appeals recently decided the case of People v. Koon. In the case, the defendant was a medical marijuana patient who was stopped by the police while driving. A blood test determined that he had active THC in his body. He was charged with <a title="Michigan Drugged Driving Lawyers" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/owpd.html">Operating With the Presence of Drugs</a> (OWPD), a crime that says a driver can be arrested with the presence of Cocaine or any Schedule 1 drug in his or her body. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug in Michigan. Therefore, the issue in the case was whether a person can be charged with OWPD for <a title="Michigan Drugged Driving Attorneys" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/owpd.html">active marijuana</a> in the body even if they legally consumed the marijuana as a medical marijuana patient.

The Michigan Court of Appeals held that even though a person legally used marijuana as a medical marijuana patient in Michigan, he or she can still be charged with OWPD if there is active THC in his or her system. This is true regardless of whether a person is driving in an impaired manner. The court decided that the mere presence of weed / marijuana / pot in the blood is conduct enough to convict a defendant. This is otherwise known as zero tolerance.
<h2>Understanding the Consequences</h2>
As criminal defense attorneys, we understand the consequences that can come from a conviction of OWPD, drunk driving, drugged driving and drug crimes. Penalties vary depending on how many prior drugged driving offenses a person has on their record, but can include penalties like incarceration, probation, community service, random alcohol and drug screening, driverâ€™s license sanctions, and the payment of fines.

Any time you are dealing with a <a title="Michigan Drugged Driving Defense" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/owpd.html">drunk or drugged driving</a> issue, you should immediately contact an attorney who practices drug law in Michigan.
