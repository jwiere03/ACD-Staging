  If involved in a motor vehicle accident,
  it is important for all parties to stop
  at the scene and wait for law
  enforcement officials to arrive. This is
  particularly true for the at-fault
  motorist, and if anyone in the struck
  vehicle sustains personal injury or
  death. As seen by the example of Adam

  accident site can instantly increase the
  severity of charges against you, and
  result in a sizable jail sentence.

Being the involvedÂ  of in a motor vehicle accident causing personal injury or death can bring criminal charges upon the at-fault motorist. However, experienced Michigan criminal defense lawyers would almost certainly recommend against leaving the scene, as doing so can instantly increase the severity of the violations listed against the driver, including an extended jail time. Such an example is seen in the case of a Taylor man who received a significant prison sentence after leaving the scene of an auto-motorcycle accident that killed another man.

According to law enforcement officials, Taylor resident Adam Hooper, 34, was driving his 2005 Saturn Vue northbound on Telegraph Road in Dearborn on September 12, 2009. However, just south of Michigan Avenue, he struck a motorcycle driven by Dearborn Heights resident Gerald Bojanowski, as the biker was turning into the parking lot of the Fort Dearborn American Legion Post. Bojanowski was on his way to the building to attend a charity event supporting local veterans when his motorcycle was hit by Hooper's vehicle. Despite the efforts of emergency medical teams at the scene, Bojanowski died as a result of the injuries sustained in the Michigan motorcycle accident.


<h2>Found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident</h2>

Instead of stopping at the crash site, Hooper continued driving, instantly turning the car-motorcycle crash into a hit-and-run accident. Following an extensive investigation completed by Dearborn Police and the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, Hooper was arrested on numerous <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/motor-vehicle-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan motor vehicle charges</a>. He was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident causing death and negligent homicide, eventually leading a Wayne County Circuit Court to sentence him to five years in prison--a higher sentence then he would have received had Hooper stayed at the scene.

Being involved in a motor vehicle collision is a scary and overwhelming process for anyone to go through, including the at-fault motorist. However, the example of Adam Hooper highlights how important it is to cooperate with law enforcement officials and always stop at accident sites. Failure to do so only creates a greater suspicion regarding your responsibility in this case, and will increase the counts against you. Because of the severity of fatal motor vehicle charges, it is essential to be proactive in securing the best defense for your case.
