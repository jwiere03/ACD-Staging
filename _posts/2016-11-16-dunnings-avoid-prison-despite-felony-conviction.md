<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been more than four months since former </span><b>Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III resigned from office in the wake of a sex crime scandal.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having been arrested and charged with </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/pandering-prostitution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pandering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/michigan/sex-crimes/prostitution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prostitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and misconduct in office, he later </span><a href="http://www.sexcrimeattorneys.com/stuart-dunnings-accepts-guilty-plea-prostitution-case.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accepted a plea bargain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that got rid of similar charges in other counties and reduced the number of charges he was facing in Ingham County in Lansing. Now it appears that there may be complications.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, Dunning's advisory </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentencing guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> call for no more than three months in jail. However, according to the Michigan Attorney General's Office, they intend to ask for a considerably longer sentence - approximately three to five years. The reason for this is because </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misconduct in Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. </span><b>As the minimum sentence can't be set any higher than two-thirds of the state's statutory maximum sentence, three to five years is the most that can occur.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In their request to the court, the Attorney General's Office wrote, "Due to the severity of the defendant's conduct, </span><b>his abuse of the public's trust, his exploitation of victims of crime whom he publicly pledged to protect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the fact that the sentencing guidelines fail to account for these and the factors discussed (in this memorandum). The People respectfully request that the Court sentence the defendant to 40 months to 5 years imprisonment in the Michigan Department of Corrections."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be seen what </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/genesee-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genesee County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circuit Court Judge Joseph Farah chooses to do. Although the case is being tried in an </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/ingham-county-criminal-attorney-lansing-michigan-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingham County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> court, </span><b>all of the Ingham County judges recused themselves due to their previous working relationships with Dunnings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As such, Judge Farah was assigned to the case. If he chooses to, Judge Farah can sentence Dunnings to serve time in jail or prison, require that he pay fines or restitution or both, and insist on probation. Any or all, or a combination of these, are all options.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite all the option available, the sentencing hearing was recently postponed. Dunnings was scheduled to be sentenced on November 10, 2016. However, at the request of Dunnings' defense attorney, Judge Farah delayed the hearing till November 22, 2016. The reason cited by the attorney was that there was </span><b>new evidence available to substantiate the fact that Dunnings was in fact in a lasting relationship with his alleged victim</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This would undermine the allegations of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prostitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Dunnings is facing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court records, Dunnings is accused of sexually exploiting a woman who came to him for help. The prosecutor's office intends to prove that Dunnings paid the woman in question for sex. The money he gave her, it is alleged, was used to pay for methadone, rent, and even a YMCA membership. But </span><b>according to Dunnings' defense attorney, the woman was actually in a several months long relationship with Dunnings as his mistress</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnings' defense attorney says that Dunnings was simply looking for a mistress, not a prostitute. "</span><b>This is seduction of a married woman. She had relations with my client on three occasions and (he) paid her rent for three to four months. That's all</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." he explained to the court. But Judge Farah claims that he doubts the relationship was anything more than sex in return for money. "I don't see anything about flowers or candy or meeting the kids." The judge said in response, "It was 'I'll pay you for sex.' How is that a seduction of a married woman?"</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be seen what evidence Dunning's attorney will be providing for the court and whether or not the judge will accept it. We will continue to monitor this case, which has </span><b>received a considerable amount of media coverage given the fact that it involves a former prosecuting attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and keep you updated.</span>
