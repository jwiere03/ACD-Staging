&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining The Kronzek Firm again as we unpack the fascinating subject of cyber crime and how it's solved. In </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/evidence-101-cyber-crimes-theyre-solved.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our previous article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we looked at exactly </span><b>what a computer forensic investigator does</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and what types of crimes they can assist in investigating. Moving forward, we are going to take a look at how cyber crimes are solved.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigating digital evidence is a unique experience. An investigator can discover evidence, pursue leads, and even track a criminal, all without leaving their desk. Which makes the computer forensic investigator </span><b>a very specific type of detective</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And while it may sound less exciting than the more </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditional methods of detecting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the impact it has on people's daily lives is far greater!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://forensicoutreach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forensicoutreach.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "Physical crimes are still a horrific problem, but the numbers pale when comparing victims. The global homicide rate for murders (not including wars, suicides and the wounded) as calculated by the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development is reported to be 441,750 shooting victims annually, </span><b>about 1/3 of the daily count of cybercrime victims</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does a computer forensics investigator go about solving crimes? The answer to that is somewhat complex, but here is a </span><b>breakdown of the average tasks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a cyber detective would have to perform as part of their job:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather, analyze and preserve information on computer systems</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retrieving and/or recreating deleted files, emails and documents</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking downloads to and from their sources</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the origins of emails and other shared digital information</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digging up buried financial records</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cracking passwords and accessing encrypted files</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncovering data that is disguised to look like something else</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linking user accounts to specific individuals</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing digital information to determine criminal activity.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is anything that should be taken away from this, it's that while the things you do in your own home, at your computer, may feel private, they're just not! Just because you deleted something, </span><b>doesn't mean that it is gone and cannot be recovered</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just because you sent something anonymously, doesn't mean it can't </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-of-a-computer-to-commit-a-crime-in-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be traced back to you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nothing is ever so well hidden, disguised, or erased, that it can't be found by a persistent investigator.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber crimes sometimes feel safer to the perpetrators because, </span><b>they happen quietly and without obvious victims </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">unlike armed robbery, arson, murder or assault, No one gets rushed to the hospital with a bullet wound. No one usually runs screaming, or ends up hiding in fear. Because there is no violence, and the perpetrator is usually alone at the time, the crime can feel less dangerous. This is a very misleading feeling, because many law enforcement agencies have well trained computer forensic investigators on their teams. And they will stop at nothing to catch their prey. </span>
