&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the answer to that question is a resounding no! There are numerous places in Michigan where no one (not even people with </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concealed carry permits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is allowed to take their gun. </span><b>Designated gun-free zones</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan include:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churches, and other places of worship</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bars</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day Care Centers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stadiums and other large concert halls</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospitals</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casinos</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Dormitories and class rooms</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>New state Senate bills aim to change gun laws in Michigan</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However that may change in the near future! Our Michigan Senate has just passed hotly contested legislation that would allow </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">licensed pistol carriers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Great Lakes State to </span><b>keep their guns with them on school property. And at the bar.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And in churches, day care centers, and concert halls. In fact, pretty much everywhere they currently </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can't</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> take their guns. The reason? It may just help to save lives in the future!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, who was one of the Senators behind the bills, "I believe citizens have the right to be </span><b>free and safe and secure and to defend themselves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and their loved ones," he said. "Responsible, well-trained, licensed gun owners may be one of those deterrents to those individuals who seek out gun-free zones as opportunities to commit heinous crimes."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He also told the Detroit Free Press that a tragic </span><b>mass shooting like the one in Texas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could have been avoided had more people had guns with them at the time. In other words, if more people were armed at some of the more </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent shooting incidents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, those people could have stepped in and saved those around them.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Many people are opposed to allowing guns in schools and churches!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone supports this proposed legislation. The bills have met with fierce resistance from including gun-control advocates and the education lobby. According to the opposition, </span><b>more guns means more people being shot, not less</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.freep.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Detroit Free Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published an opinion piece in response to the Senate's support of these bills, entitled "Michigan Senate loses its mind, votes to allow guns in schools and churches!" </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Rifle Association and other supporters of the new proposal often point to the City of Chicago where the entire city is a gun free zone. The City of Chicago does not have a single gun shop in it’s borders. Criminal defense attorney Charles Kronzek reminds us that year after year, “gun free zone” <strong>Chicago is the murder capital of America, </strong>averaging more than 50 murders every month. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does this mean for you? The answer is: currently, nothing. Although the senate has passed the legislation, </span><b>it still needs to pass the House before heading to the Governor's desk</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for approval. Although the House is GOP-led, which has led many to believe that the bills will gain support there also, Governor Snyder may not support them when they reach his desk for a signature.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, after the mass shooting of elementary schoolchildren in Connecticut, Governor Snyder refused to sign a similar bill package making </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan gun carry laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more lenient. With regard to this most recent set of bills, he has refused to comment until they reach him. So as of now, </span><b>no one knows what the future holds for Michigan gun owners</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But The Kronzek Firm will keep a close on these bills, and let you know if your gun rights change! </span>
