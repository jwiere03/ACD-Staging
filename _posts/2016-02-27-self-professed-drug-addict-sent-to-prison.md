<h2>Drug Addict Convicted on Controlled Substance and Marijuana Charges</h2>
John Charles Kuhns, a 41-year-old resident of Howell, stood in court just days ago and tearfully addressed the Judge. "Your honor, I'm a drug addict." he said, "I have been for a long time." Just moments before that, he had told his mother that he loved her. But despite his obvious remorse and self-awareness about his drug addict condition, Kuhns is still going to prison.<!--more-->

He was arrested in July of 2015 after undercover narcotics agents found guns, marijuana and cocaine inside his home. According to the testimony provided at court by a number of different officers, a brick of cocaine was found inside Kuhn's oven that measured 4" x 4", and almost 2" thick. Depending on how that amount of cocaine was divided and cut, it could be worth anywhere between $21,000 and $250,000.

In addition, during a search of the home, law enforcement found two marijuana growing operations totaling 118 plants, along with 28 grams of the final product. They also discovered heroin, digital scales which are assumed to be for weighing drugs, $880 in cash and three guns.

Kuhns, who served on a local fire department for five years, and worked in road construction for 18 years until a back injury forced him to switch to real estate, was facing multiple felonies. In total, he was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and two counts of felony firearm.

He fled the state after his home was searched, going first to Florida and then to California. But it was while staying in California that Kuhns was arrested for drunk driving, which is how he ended up back in Michigan. But according to police, someone that they believe was actually Kuhns called them up, refuting the fact that he had been called " a cocaine kingpin", and saying that he was willing to provide information to them in order to help himself out.

Earlier this month, Kuhns entered into a plea bargain, in which the prosecution agreed to run the two possession charges concurrently, and also to cap Kuhn's sentence at the midway point. This would mean that Kuhn's sentence would not exceed the halfway point of the state's sentencing guidelines.

At his recent sentencing hearing, Circuit Court Judge Michael P. Hatty sentenced Kuhn to 68 months to 20 years in prison for delivery/manufacture of 50 grams to 449 grams of a controlled substance. 68 months equates to approximately 5 years and eight months. He was also sentenced to 56 months to seven years for delivery/manufacture of marijuana. As promised, these sentences will run concurrently, but will beginÂ after he first serves two years for felony firearm.
