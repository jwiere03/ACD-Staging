&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof is the mind behind a new and very controversial two-bill package that has been introduced. If </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(m2wztduqo0m5w24aavzpn53q))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=2017-SB-0594"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 0594</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes it all the way through the legislature and past the governor's desk, Michigan would be allowed to authorize </span><b>private, and potentially for-profit, police agencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which would have full arrest powers. But what does that mean exactly, and what does law enforcement have to say about it?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Meekhof, this legislation would allow Michigan corporations, associations, school districts, among others, to hire private</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> police agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for specific time and places, where they would provide legal law enforcement services. This includes </span><b>all of the protections and authority granted to public police officers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The reason, he explained, is because MIchigan's need for law enforcement services is at an all time high, whereas our police departments are spread thin and working at capacity.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Current law enforcement, however, thinks it's a terrible idea! In an interview with Michigan Radio, Bob Stevenson, executive director of the </span><a href="http://www.michiganpolicechiefs.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and former Livonia police chief explained why </span><b>so many local police agencies are upset</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the bills. "The best police are local police. We wouldn’t want private police to start taking the place of public police." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But why, you may wonder? Well, according to Stevenson, "There are some things you have to pay for, and professional </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are one of those." The reasons, he explained, have a lot to do with the </span><b>total lack of adequate training and accountability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for private police officers by the proposed laws. A lack that Stevenson called "appalling." And he's not the only one.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Howell Police Chief George Basar also spoke out against the bills, saying that it felt to him that "We’re </span><b>creating a Blackwater for police in the state of Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Blackwater, now known as the </span><a href="https://www.academi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was founded by retired Navy Seal Officer Erik Prince, and provides contractual security services to the United States Government. "It almost feels like we’re putting together a mercenary force to police in some of our communities." Basar said, a point that Meekhof took offense to.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Meekhof is fiercely behind these bills, saying that he would do whatever it took to make them happen.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meekhof referred to Basar's commentary on the matter "out of line." Although </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the accountability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these private police forces is currently a point of contention, Meekhof has gone on the record to say that his bills do in fact include numerous accountability standards for the proposed private police forces. What he isn't discussing, however, is </span><b>who wants these police forces</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meekhof has said that many groups, including corporations, homeowners associations and large condominium complexes have all come forward to say that they want access to private police forces. However </span><b>Meekhof refuses to name names</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because the Michigan Legislature is not subject to public records requests under the state </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(53qax15vnjhfjef5dw1zjhzv))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-act-442-of-1976"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom of Information Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, numerous media sources have tried and failed to find out who is the driving force behind the bills.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many questions are still unanswered - a point that Michigan Association of Sheriffs Executive Director Blaine Koops points out in an interview with WWMT. "Who does the prosecution on the cases, is it done through the city, is it done through the county prosecutor's office? How are these units dispatched, is it done through a public entity such as a centralized 911? If they make an arrest, </span><b>who is responsible for that arrest?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do they take them to the local county facility or jail on tax payer dollars?" </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, these bills have caused a great number of people to draw lines in the sand, picking sides in favor of what they believe is right for Michigan's residents. Attorney Chuck Kronzek  reminds readers that, "Michigan already has lots of private police forces with the same powers as municipal law enforcement officers. For example, </span><b>Wayne State University, Central Michigan University, Michigan State University and the University of Michigan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all have their own private police departments. Many local school districts also have their own private police departments. The concept of privatizing law enforcement is nothing new. Similarly, private, for-profit prisons have existed in America for decades."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This controversial bill package has a long way to go before it becomes law, assuming it ever makes it that far.
