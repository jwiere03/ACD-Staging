<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us one last time to wrap up the topic of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/expungement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expungement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan. In case you are just joining us, expungement is very similar to having a person's criminal records sealed. What this means is that either specific parts of, or all of, a criminal record will be unavailable to the public. Technically, there is a difference though. While </span><b>a sealed record means that the record still exists but cannot be viewed by the public without a court order</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an expunged record is destroyed. Sometimes however, people use the term "expungement" to refer to sealed records.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have met all of the criteria for expungement in Michigan, and your crime isn't one of those that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/possible-get-criminal-record-expunged-michigan-part-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disqualifies you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from expungement eligibility, </span><b>you and your attorney will work together to get your criminal record expunged</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Usually, the process of expunging a criminal record involves completing the correct paperwork, getting the court documents pertaining to the original case, and then filing the petition with the court. In </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/ingham-county-criminal-attorney-lansing-michigan-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingham County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this can be somewhat time consuming.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that if the paperwork is filled out incorrectly, there is any required information that was left out, or the paperwork was not submitted properly, the court will consider your application invalid. However, if you invest in an </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who will ensure that your paperwork is properly filed, </span><b>then the court will weigh your “circumstances and behavior” against the “public welfare.”</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that it falls to you and your knowledgeable attorney to prove to the court that you deserve to have your criminal record erased. </span><b>You will have to show the court evidence that your actions and behavior from the date of the conviction until the time of the application, are those of a law abiding citizen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Kronzek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an experienced criminal defense attorney who has handled numerous expungements, "You will have to prove that all of your actions and choices have been consistent with the goals of protecting public welfare, and that you warrant the expungement of a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal conviction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the court denies your petition, you may not file another petition about the same criminal conviction for three years after the date of the denial. </span><b>The only exception to this rule is if the court specifically names an earlier date</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If however, your petition is granted, you will have the benefit of being able to legally and rightfully claim that you do not have a criminal record.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although seeking an expungement can be a time consuming and somewhat costly process, the benefits can be enormous! </span><b>Being able to tell a prospective employer that you don't have a criminal record can have a significant impact on whether or not you are likely to get the job</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You may also be eligible for student loans that were previously unavailable to you, and also for financial assistance with housing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, you may also be eligible for a significant number of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you might have been denied, had you been on record as a convicted criminal. </span><b>Careers like being a registered nurse or registered public accountant may now be viable options</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should also now be able to volunteer at your children's school, where running a background check is becoming more commonplace.</span>
