As the legal careers of dedicated Michigan criminal defense attorneys revolve around representing individuals accused of a variety of criminal charges, it is important to update the public on relevant information that could be beneficial to them. Once convicted of a crime, immediate roadblocks are in front of that person that prevents them from fully rehabilitating into society, such as the inability to get a job and housing. This factor greatly influences the number of people who go back into police custody after being accused of another crime.


<h2>Only the most violent offenders are locked up</h2>

Washtenaw County for example, has a low commitment rate in general, meaning that only the most violent offenders are locked up for Michigan criminal charges. However, the same county has significant barriers to two key causes of success for ex-cons: housing and employment. Mary King, the community coordinator for the Michigan Prisoner ReEntry Initiative, directly links recidivism and the inability for these individuals to secure employment. In a presentation she gave to the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners last week, provided data stated that 82 percent of businesses require criminal background checks. However,only 12.5 percent of will hire somebody convicted with a felony crime.

King cited Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when she suggested that the county pass an ordinance that prohibits criminal history check boxes from being included in job applications. Once a box is checked, she explained, applicants who admit they have a criminal history are immediately discarded and almost never get an interview. Numerous cities across the state and country have already placed a similar ban effectively, such as Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. Additionally, she also referenced a 1997 study that discovered 1 in 20 background checks produce inaccurate criminal records, ultimately allowing 300,000 innocent workers each year to be denied employment.

King provided four main reasons why the box should be prohibited on job applications:
<ul>
	<li>Unfortunately, people of minority background and of color are more likely to be arrested, convicted, and jailed disproportionately to their representation in the general population.</li>
	<li>It is the county's responsibility to ensure that its businesses have fair and appropriate policies regarding background checks and screening throughout the application process.</li>
	<li>Adopting such an ordinance can serve as a model for private businesses to do the same.</li>
	<li>It is the responsibility of the board of commissioners to "support programs which result in successful reintegration of persons who have come through the criminal justice system."</li>
</ul>
Advocates in the State of Michigan agree, currently focusing their efforts on reducing recidivism by offering services and supervision tailored for each offender. According to King, this would be administered through the state and local collaboration from the time someone enters incarceration, to the time that they are reintegrated with the community, and even long after that to ensure success. This would not only maintain the safety of the public, but also assist ex-convicts rejoin society and still have the opportunity to succeed.

As seen by the situation described above, being accused of Michigan criminal charges can have life-changing consequences. Not only does conviction pose a significant disadvantage for securing employment or housing, they are also subject to the loss of driving privileges, fines, and/or jail time.
