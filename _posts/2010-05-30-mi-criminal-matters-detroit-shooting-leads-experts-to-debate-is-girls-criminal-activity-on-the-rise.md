National statistics maintain that of the 61,406 non-fatal shootings that occurred in the United States in 2008, only 676 involved female teenagers. Clearly, it is much rarer occurrence than a shooting by the hands of a male--the Detroit Free Press reported that data compiled from 2005 showed that men are four times more likely to commit an aggravated assault than females, regardless of their age.

Many experts agree with the statistics, maintaining that girl-on-girl violence is pretty rare. However, a Detroit shooting of a 13 year-old girl last week at the hands of another teenage female has left experienced criminologists, as well as <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">Michigan criminal defense attorneys</a> in a bit of a debate--is girls' violence and crime on the rise?

According to the Detroit Police Department, an unidentified 13 year-old was among a group of girls that approached two other teenage females sitting on their front porch. Around 8:00 p.m., two of the girls from opposite parties became embroiled in an altercation, and began to fight with one another. It was during this argument which one female approached on the porch pulled out a handgun and fired it. The 13 year-old victim was taken to a local hospital and listed in stable condition, while the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office accused the 14 year-old teen of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">Michigan assault charges</a> with intent of murder, as well as gun violations.

Last Wednesday, Wayne County Juvenile Court referee ruled that the suspect could be released on a $25,000 bond. After that is posted, the teen will be subjected to house arrest, barred from contact with the victim, and required to wear a tether. Additionally, her parents must sign an affidavit attesting that no guns or weapons are in their home before their daughter can return.

<h2>Detroit women less likely to be armed than men?</h2>

While most leading criminology researchers insist that Detroit women are much less likely to be armed than men, Michigan State University professor Carl Taylor argues otherwise. The author of "Girls, Gangs, Women, and Drugs," a commentary on urban crime, maintains that the national statistics are not reflective of street reality. "I've discovered that young women are threatening, fighting, defending, carrying guns, and participating in the violence on the streets," Taylor explained. "The streets are rough, and there are very tough girls in Detroit."

Although examples are rare, Michigan juvenile crimes involving girls do occur. Just because they are, as Taylor maintains, unreported or underreported, does not mean that a female suspect will face any lesser punishments because of their gender. Similar to male juvenile offenders, it is possible to have precious freedoms and liberties taken away, even resulting in imprisonment. Because the consequences are so severe, it is essential to be proactive in securing the best defense for your case.
