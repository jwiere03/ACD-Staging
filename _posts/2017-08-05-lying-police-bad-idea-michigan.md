&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's probably safe to assume that most people know it's a bad idea to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lie to the cops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, not everyone knows exactly why. And as it turns out, here in Michigan </span><b>the "why" is actually very important</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Michigan law </span><b>defines lying to the police about an alleged crime as "making a false report of a crime"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can actually mean several things: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand, this can mean denying your part in a criminal undertaking.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also mean attempting to point the finger of blame at someone else in an effort to redirect </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a criminal investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> away from yourself, or </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retelling the sequence of events to make your part in them look less involved or direct. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, getting someone else to lie on your behalf can result in the same charges.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact the law defines it as "A person who intentionally </span><b>makes a false report of the commission of a crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . . . to a peace officer, police agency of this state or of a local unit of government, 9-1-1 operator, or any other governmental employee . . . is guilty of a crime."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/pre-arrest-help-from-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if the police are questioning you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of an ongoing criminal investigation, and </span><b>the answers you provide are in substantively untruthful</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you could be charged with "making a false report of a crime". But this is where it gets somewhat complicatedâ€¦.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the crime being investigated is a misdemeanor under Michigan law, like Leaving the Scene of an Accident, or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestic Violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then the individual accused of falsifying a report will be charged with a misdemeanor. However, </span><b>if the crime is question is a felony</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed Robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Degree Criminal Sexual Assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the charge of falsifying a report will be a felony charge. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing to remember is the fact that, if the case goes to court and you are called on to </span><b>provide testimony under oath</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can also be charged with perjury if it becomes known that you lied in court.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, a misdemeanor charge of making a false report of a crime is punishable by up to 93 days in jail and a possible fine of $500, or both. A felony charge of the same crime, however, is </span><b>punishable by up to four years in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a possible fine of up to $2,000 fine, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While police often choose not to pursue charges against individuals for falsifying a report of a crime, </span><b>it does happen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sanilac-reckless-driving-causing-death.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when it does</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these charges are taken very seriously, both by law enforcement and by the court. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you are being questioned by the police with regard to a crime, we would strongly suggest that you </span><b>invoke your Fifth Amendment rights</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and stay politely silent. Rather than risk additional charges by lying to a police officer, we would advise that you </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">politely refuse to answer any questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until your </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">skilled criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is present and can ensure that your rights are being protected throughout the process. Your very next step should be to make that important call to The Kronzek Firm at 1 800-576-6035. </span>
