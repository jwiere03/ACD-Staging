<span style="font-weight: 400;">Six people are now facing federal charges here in Michigan, after border patrol agents busted a </span><b>human smuggling operation in Port Huron</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Michigan. Port Huron is in St. Clair County, Michigan. The people arrested were apparently Polish citizens.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to numerous media sources, the case began when Federal border patrol agents patrolling the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/st-clair-county-criminal-defense-attorneys-michigan.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Clair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> River </span><b>noticed two people in a boat heading directly for Canadian waters</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The boat, named Sacrebleu which means 'Sacred Blue' in French, contained two people. American border patrol agents contacted their Canadian counterparts across the river and reported the boat as a vessel to watch.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s exactly what the Canadian border patrol authorities did. They </span><b>watched the boat dock, and then watched four people climb aboard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The boat immediately headed back towards Michigan shoreline and the Canadian border authorities returned the call, reporting the incoming vessel with it's additional human cargo.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just after 2:30 pm, the boat docked in Michigan at Port Huron and </span><b>the six people onboard were arrested</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The case has since been accepted for prosecution by the Detroit U.S. Attorney’s Office in the  Eastern District of Michigan. They are working in conjunction with the </span><b>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Border Enforcement Security Task Force</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<h2>Lisiecki is facing single counts of Bringing In and Harboring Aliens</h2>

<b>The boat operator, Piotr Lisiecki, has been charged with two federal crimes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He is facing single counts of Bringing In and Harboring Aliens and Improper Entry by an Alien. The remaining five people on the boat, namely Mona Dolinska, Maria Hauf, Jan Hauf, Roman Kowalski and Wanda Kowalska were also all charged. They are all facing single counts of </span><b>Improper Entry by an Alien</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under federal law, Improper Entry by an Alien is defined as "Any alien who (1) enters or</span><b> attempts to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or (2) </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eludes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examination or inspection by immigration officers." It is punishable by imprisonment for up to six months. Any subsequent offenses are </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">punishable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by up to 18 months in a federal prison.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released by the United States Customs and Border Protection, a department of U.S. Homeland Security, Chief Patrol Agent Douglas Harrison praised the efforts of the agents involved. "</span><b>This was an outstanding coordinated effort between two countries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our agents' keen sense of situational awareness and our interoperability with (the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) were instrumental in coordinating this cross-border smuggling attempt.”</span>
