<h2><b>Drug Raid Results in Seven Arrests</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, September 6th, during the early hours of the morning in Port Huron, police conducted a drug raid that resulted in multiple arrests, and thousands of dollars worth of illegal drugs seized. </span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a press release from the St. Clair County Sheriff's Department, the investigation that led to the raid involved many agencies working together. The Port Huron Police Neighborhood Enforcement Team, the St. Clair County Sheriff Road Patrol, and the Sheriffâ€™s Office Special Response Team all assisted in the investigation.</span>

Sheriff Tim Donnellon explained that the investigation began when officers started looking into the sale of meth in the Port Huron area. The information led officers to a specific group of people suspected of selling drugs in the area. Police received two search warrants, which they executed at about 2 am that Sunday.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement seized a total of $28,000 worth of crystal meth, along with $1,500 worth of heroin, and $500 worth of marijuana from a property on Pine Grove Avenue. There was also a large quantity of cash confiscated along with the drugs. In total, $30,000 worth of drugs were removed from the scene by officers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven people were arrested. Three men and three women from Port Huron, all ranging in age from 23 to 33 and a 21-year-old woman from the New York area. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities say that the expected charges include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possession with intent to deliver crystal <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/Michigan-Methamphetamine-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers-drug-crime-Muskegon-county-MI">methamphetamine</a>, possession with intent to deliver <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html" target="_blank">heroin</a>, and possession with intent to deliver <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana-overview-possession-delivery-use-Marijuana-Defense-Attorney" target="_blank">marijuana</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, heroin and marijuana are both classified as Schedule 1 drugs, while meth is classified as a schedule 2 drug.
