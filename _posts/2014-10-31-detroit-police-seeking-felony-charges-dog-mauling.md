It seems the Detroit Police have had a change of heart with regard to the recent tragic dog mauling that took place on the east side. Steve Constantine, the victim who was viciously attacked by 12 pit bulls and badly mauled, recently had one of his arms amputated as a result. His injuries were so severe that more than two weeks later, he has yet to leave the hospital.

The Detroit Police are apparently requesting felony charges from the prosecutor's office, in particular, a charge of harboring a vicious animal causing serious injury. Formerly, Derrick Felton who is the owner of the pack of dogs, had received only misdemeanor citations because police believed that there was no malicious intent involved in the incident.<!--more-->

Maria Miller with the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office has said that no charges have been filed yet, as completing a warrant review takes time. A decision is pending, she says, but should not be expected this week. In the mean time, however, Constantine has filed a civil suit against Felton, seeking $25,000 in damages.
<h2>Legal Representation</h2>
He is represented by Mark Bernstein of the Sam Bernstein Law Firm, who has said that, "This is, short of death, perhaps the most gruesome injury I have seen in my career." He went on to describe the victim's horrific injuries, saying "He’s lost limbs; he may lose more limbs. He’s had probably half a dozen significant surgeries, and he’s scheduled to have perhaps up to 35 more."

Police say that the dogs had likely escaped through the side door of Felton's unkempt home, but they are not certain what provoked the attack. Harry Ward, director of Detroit Animal Control, explained that this was not a case of unfed animals looking for something to eat. Food was apparently readily available for them in their home, they were simply out of control and untrained.

In the written report submitted by Officer Adam Sexron after the event, the following description was included: "As I approached on foot towards the victim and aggressive animals I … was able to take aim on the aggressive pack of dogs who were actively removing large chunks of flesh from the (victim's) limbs. I checked my back drop noticing it was clear and in defense of the victim I (discharged) my firearm numerous times striking all four of my intended targets (dogs)."

In his recent press release regarding the case, Bernstein spoke about the civil responsibilities of a dog owner. "This is not a case about pit bulls, it’s a case about people and their reckless conduct, which, in my respects, terrorizes communities...we have had enough, and many other people have as well; and this case hopefully will send a clear message that this type of conduct is unacceptable."
