&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the movies, everyone carries their guns whenever and wherever they like, and there are never any consequences. In fact, the idea of being armed can seem so normal to some people, that they sometimes </span><b>don't stop to think about how the laws may apply to them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (And what the consequences are if they don't follow those laws!) But since this is Michigan, and not a movie, it's very important that you understand what our law says about where you can carry your gun, and where you can't. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><b>can you carry your gun in your car in Michigan?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What about storing your gun in your glovebox, or center console? Is that okay? The answer actually depends on on very important factor - do you have a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/carrying-concealed-weapon-michigan-firearm-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concealed carry permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CPL)? If you do have a legally obtained CPL in MIchigan, then yes, you may store your gun in your car. If you don't, you could get into some very serious trouble.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Picture this. You and a few friends get together for target practice. You fire your weapons safely, exercising caution and following the law. But halfway through, you get a call from your spouse. One of the kids is running a fever and you need to get home quickly. A trip to the ER may be in the books. So you say a hurried goodbye to your friends and </span><b>toss your gun into the glovebox</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the way home, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a cop pulls you over</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for speeding. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You were in such a hurry to get home, that you didn't notice the speed limit drop as you went through that residential neighborhood back there, and now you're looking at a ticket for 10 over. Problem is, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when the officer asks for your license</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and registration, you suddenly remember that there's a gun in your glovebox. You have no choice. You open the glove box. But the officer sees your weapon and </span><b>immediately he's alarmed and asking to see your CPL</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Except, you don't have one…. And now a speeding ticket is the last of your worries. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, all firearms carried inside a car are considered to be "concealed." This means that if you have your gun under your seat, in your glove box, stashed in the center console, or even in your coat pocket while you're driving, </span><b>it will be considered "concealed" by a cop</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Carrying a concealed weapon without a CPL is a five year felony in Michigan. You do the math.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law does include a few broad exceptions to that law that do allow people to </span><b>lawfully carry weapons in their cars under certain circumstances</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please remember though, that these exceptions only apply to people who are </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally allowed to own weapons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan. So if your criminal history or mental health have made legal gun ownership impossible in Michigan, then these exceptions DO NOT apply to you. (If you’ve lost your right to carry a gun but want to explore having that right restored to you, read more at </span><a href="http://www.restoremygunrights.info"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.RestoreMyGunRights.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)  </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law does allow for the transportation of guns for "lawful purposes." </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until 2012, a lawful purpose was defined as going to or from hunting areas, public shooting facilities, gun repair shops, and private property where a gun can be used. When the law was amended, </span><b>these definitions of lawful purpose were removed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What the law does still clearly define, however, is </span><b><i>how</i></b><b> a gun must be transported</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the owner doesn't have a CPL. Specifically, your weapon must be:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unloaded</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contained in a case designed for transporting weapons</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the trunk of your vehicle (if the vehicle doesn't have a trunk, then the gun must be put in a place where it isn't readily accessible to the vehicle's occupants.)</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's also important to remember that these rules don't only apply to cars. </span><b>The definition of "motor vehicle" in Michigan is very broad</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and includes motorcycles, golf carts, ATVs, riding lawnmowers, commercial vehicles and even motorized scooters. Possessing a firearm on federal property is a whole different issue. If you’re going to visit a national park, or a national historic monument, speak with a qualified attorney first if you plan to carry a firearm. Best practice is to leave your gun at home. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please remember that while the Constitution affords us the right to keep and bear arms, owning a gun in Michigan is not a right afforded to everyone. For those who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i> <a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gun-right-restoration.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally own firearms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are still laws governing</span><b> the use, transportation and handling of guns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Failure to follow the law can result in lengthy prison sentences.</span>
