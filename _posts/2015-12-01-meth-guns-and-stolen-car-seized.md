<h2>Calhoun County Meth Arrests</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of people from Springport and Battle Creek are probably looking at some very serious prison time in the near future. The man and woman, whose identities have not been released to the public as of yet, were arrested after a high speed car chase. And as if that isn't going to cause them enough grief, the items officers found inside their car, and the car itself for that matter, are only likely to make the situation worse.</span><!--more-->

Apparently it all began when a Calhoun County Sheriff's Deputy pulled over a vehicle for a traffic violation at about 10:30 pm. But once the driver pulled over, the details get a little hazy. The officer, it seems, suffered a minor injury, although no one is sure how that happened yet. And the 26-year-old driver escaped the vehicle on foot.

The injured deputy then arrested the passenger, a 24-year-old woman, and called for back-up. A perimeter was set up by officers from a number of different departments in the area, including the Michigan State Police and Emmett Township Department of Public Safety.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was tracked for almost a mile by a K-9 unit from the Battle Creek Police Department. Once he was discovered, the man was immediately arrested. But running from the police is only part of the issues this fugitive will have to face in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The vehicle he was driving at the time that he was pulled over, was discovered to be stolen from Chicago. In addition, police found <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">methamphetamine</a> and firearms inside the car, along with a number of other stolen items that were not identified in the press release.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The driver, a resident of Springport, has been charged with multiple criminalÂ offenses. He is facing single counts of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resisting a police officer causing injury, possession of stolen property, carrying a concealed weapon, and felon in possession of a firearm. All of these charges are felonies under Michigan law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">His passenger, a young woman from Battle Creek, is also being charged. She is facing single counts of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> possession with intent to deliver meth, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank">possession of a concealed weapon</a>, and possession of stolen property. All three of these charges are felonies. Since her arrest, she is being held at the Calhoun County Jail, along with her arrested partner.</span>
