Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, isn't from Michigan, we know. But he has a number of fans here in the mitten state and so we thought this case was worth discussing. Also, it's a valuable wake-up call for people everywhere, who mistakenly assume that fame and fortune mean you're above the law. The truth is, no one is exempt from the letter of the law.<!--more-->

According to authorities from Putnam County, Tennessee, Nelly's tour bus was pulled over by state troopers after it was noted that required documentation was missing. Bumper stickers for the U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association were conspicuously absent from the vehicle's exterior.

However, once the trooper got closer to the bus, he claimed to have smelled marijuana. While medical marijuana bills are pending in Texas, as of now, no amount of marijuana for any purpose is legal in Texas. Which gave the trooper reason enough to have a closer look.

<h2>Drugs and weapons found on the tour bus</h2>

Inside the bus were Nelly and six other people, along with an undisclosed quantity of marijuana, methamphetamines and assorted drug paraphernalia. In addition,Â the group had a number of handguns, including a gold-plated 50-caliber Desert Eagle Pistol, a 45-caliber Taurus Pistol and a 500 magnum Smith &amp; Wesson.

It is worth noting at this point that one of the members of Nelly's entourage was a convicted felon, named Brian Jones, who was in possession of a gun at the time that police intercepted him. Both Nelly and Jones were arrested and transported to Putnam County Jail.

Under Texas law, Nelly has been charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. Jail records show that his bail, which was granted at $10,000, was posted within hours of the arraignment.

Had he been arrested in Michigan, the firearms possession charge would also have been a felony, as would any charge for the possession of meth. However, depending upon where in the state he was arrested, marijuana related charges may not have even happened.

It will be interesting to see how this case shapes up, and whether or not the famous rapper accepts a plea deal, or decides to take his case to trial.
