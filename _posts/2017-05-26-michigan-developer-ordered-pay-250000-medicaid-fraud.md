&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">56-year-old Bashar Imam is a well-known investor and developer in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/oakland-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-expert-lawyer-pontiac-farmington-novi-southfield.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Troy area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He is also a respected member of Detroit's Syrian immigrant community. Ask people in his community to describe him, and they would </span><b>most likely use words like 'entrepreneur', 'hard worker' and 'prosperous businessman.'</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And while those may all be true, they are currently overshadowed by other words, like 'court', 'sentenced', “thief” and 'fraud'.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imam appeared in </span><a href="http://cc.ingham.org/ClerksOffice.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lansing's 30th Circuit Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently, where Circuit Court Judge Clinton Canady ordered him to pay back no less than $250,000 as part of a settlement agreement in his fraud case. Of that total, </span><b>$100,000 is meant to pay back the money that Imam defrauded from Medicaid</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while $100 is the total of his fines, and the remainder is meant to cover court costs. The appears to be another case of greed and dishonesty by a wealthy businessman. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to court documents, Imam is in charge of the medical billing for three Hamtramck clinics. There he </span><b>submitted 'up coded' bills for the same patient at several different locations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, claiming that they were from an urgent care center when in fact they weren't. The Attorney General's office opened an investigation into the situation when a data mining project run by the Health Care Fraud Division found records of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-insurance-fraud-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improper Medicaid billings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>This fraud case was investigated by the Attorney General's office.</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of this year, the Michigan Attorney General's office brought a single count of Medicaid Fraud against Imam. The charge was a felony, punishable by up to four years in prison and fines of up to $50,000. However, </span><b>Imam's attorneys worked out a plea bargain deal with the prosecutor's office</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Imam pled guilty as part of the settlement deal. In return he was only sentenced to one day of jail time, and required to pay a substantial sum of money in the form of restitution and fines.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, </span><b>medicaid fraud is a serious problem that affects all Michigan residents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not sure how someone else's fraud could affect you? Well, the MDHHS says that </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/health-care-fraud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Care Fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses up "valuable public funds needed to help vulnerable children and adults access health care."</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Common examples of Medicaid Fraud include:</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billing for medical services not actually performed </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing unnecessary services </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billing for more expensive services </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billing for services separately that should legitimately be one billing </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billing more than once for the same medical service </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dispensing generic drugs but billing for brand-name drugs </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving or accepting money, gifts or services in return for medical services, (eg: kickbacks) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falsifying cost reports </span></li>
</ul>
