Minecraft - a game that appeals to a vast array of people ranging in age from 6 to 60. But like all internet interactions with other people, exercising caution is a must, especially when your online gaming relationship moves on to become something more.

This advice could have saved a 14-year-old Isabella County girl from a great deal of grief with regard to a recent incident that landed a Texan man in jail.<!--more-->

According to law enforcement, 25-year-old Glen Timberlake of Austin, Texas, developed a relationship with a young girl from Mount Pleasant while playing Minecraft online. It has been said that the two met when the girl was 12, but no information is provided regarding that meeting.

The long-distance friendship they struck up, however, continued for two years. At some point during this period, it became sexual. Timberlake is alleged to have sent the girl photos and videos that were sexual in nature, one of which apparently included a dog.

The young girlâ€™s mother is said to have become aware of the relationship, although little is known of her responses to it. However, when Timberlake drove all the way up to Michigan to meet the young unidentified girl, her mother recognized him when he arrived outside their home.


<h2>Timberlake arrested, revealed he had a 13 inch butcher knife</h2>

She contacted the Isabella County sheriff's department and reported his arrival to authorities. This led to further disturbing discoveries. Timberlake was arrested and a search of his person revealed a 13 inch butcher knife which he had felt compelled to bring with him from Texas. It was apparently in the front pocket of his pants at the time of his arrest.

When asked by deputies what his intentions had been regarding the knife, his only explanation was that he had brought it with him because he wanted to get some answers. However, what the questions may have been has yet to be revealed.

Timberlake is currently being held in the Isabella County Jail on a $700,000.00 cash or surety bond. He is facing a whole slew of charges, including:
<ul>

No information has been made available as of yet regarding Timberlake's next scheduled court date.
