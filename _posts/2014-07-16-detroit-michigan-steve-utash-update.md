<h2><b>Defendants Sentenced</b></h2>
Wonzey Saffold, a 30-year-old resident of Detroit and one of the men charged with the mob <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/detroit-man-beaten-mob.html">beating of Steve Utash</a>, was sentenced recently to a minimum of 6 years in prison. He is one of several people who are facing prison sentences for their involvement in the attack on Utash.

Utash was attacked and beaten so brutally that he was hospitalized and held in a medically induced coma for weeks following the attack. The mob that attacked Utash occurred after Utash accidentally hit a 10-year-old boy with his pickup truck. The boy, who was not seriously harmed in the accident, stepped out in front of Utash’s moving vehicle.<!--more-->

When Utash stopped his truck and got out to help, a group of up to 12 people surrounded and attacked him. The mob was captured on the surveillance tape of a nearby gas station, which has helped police in determining what happened and who was involved.

Wayne County Circuit Judge James Callahan issued the sentences in court for two of the defendants in this case. Saffold, who pled guilty last month to <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">assault with intent to do great bodily harm</a>, was sentenced to prison for a minimum of 6 years and 4 months, and up to 10 years. This was the longest sentence issued thus far in this case.

Another suspect in the beating, 18-year-old <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/detroit-mob-beating-update.html">Bruce Wimbush</a>, was sentenced to only three years of probation under a special youth sentencing program that erases the conviction from his record if he complies with conditions during the probation period. Wimbush had accepted a plea deal that allowed him a reduced sentence in return for testifying against the other three adult defendants during the trial.

Several members of Utash's family, including his brother, sister and one of his daughters, spoke at the trial. Mandi Emerick, one of Utash's two daughters, cried as she read a letter her father had written to the defendants. Both Saffold and Wimbush apologized to Utash's family during the sentencing, and appeared contrite and ashamed.

The remaining two adult suspects, 19-year-old Latrez Cummings, and 24-year-old James Davis, were sentenced on Thursday, July 11th. Wayne County Circuit Judge James Callahan sentenced Davis to one year of jail time with the possibility of work release, and 5 years probation. The sentence is very lenient, but the judge felt that Davis was sufficiently remorseful. In addressing the court at the sentencing, Davis said, "I want to apologize to society. I really want you to give me a second chance ... I don’t want my whole life to be judged on that one moment."

Sentencing has been delayed until July 17th for Cummings, who was supposed to be in school at the time of the attack.  The Court is waiting on verification of Cummings’ school records.
