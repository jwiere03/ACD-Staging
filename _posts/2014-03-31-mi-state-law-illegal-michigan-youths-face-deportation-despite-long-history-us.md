In 2010, one hot topic in both American politics and law has been the question of how to treat illegal immigrants. While there are thousands of undocumented workers living in this country, many state governments have made it a priority to seek out illegal aliens and deport them, even if they have committed no criminal act. For experienced criminal lawyers in Michigan, it is particularly difficult to see this happen to youths who were brought to the United States by their parents and have lived here for several years.
<h2>Immigration Issues Faced By Michigan</h2>
The state of Michigan is not exempt from the controversial topic of illegal immigrants, as seen by the great number of undocumented residents who are currently facing deportation. Many of these people are minors or young adults who have lived in the United States for a significant portion of their lives. Generally, these individuals were brought here by their parents (also illegal aliens) at a young age. Being under their guardianship, it is difficult to assume that a child would have much opportunity to secure legal entry into the country.

Such an example of this is 21 year-old Russian native Ivan Nikolov, who is being held in Calhoun County Jail after being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Agents raided his Roseville home in search of his mother, but took him into custody as well. Nikolov and his mother entered the United States over a decade ago to join his father, but were detained at the border. Although they were released pending an immigration hearing, the two never received notification of the hearing, nor the steps it took to become a legal U.S. citizen. The two moved to Detroit, where Nikolov attended school and has been engaged to an American citizen for three years. Until his arrest, he worked with his mother cleaning houses and office buildings in the area.

Although his mom married an American citizen, ICE agents surrounded their home on May 5th. When they failed to provide the necessary documents, the two were taken into custody. Nikolov's mother was deported back to Russia last week, but the 21 year-old received a reprieve due to political pressure from immigration activists.  Advocates for Nikolov are pushing for the DREAM act to pass, which would allow illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children the offer of citizenship by either serving two years in the military or going to college.

Even though his deportation has been stalled, it is certainly still possible that Nikolov will be deported back to his native country. Hopefully, his lack of a criminal history will help persuade Immigration and Customs Officials to keep Nikolov in the United States, and send him back to his fiancee'. Regardless of age, however, facing deportation is a terrifying experience for anyone to go through.   With so much at stake,  you need to do everything you can to protect your rights.  Working with knowledgeable attorneys is one step in the right direction.  Contact The Kronzek Firm PLC today!
