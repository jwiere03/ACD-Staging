In these hard economic times, it can be particularly tempting to take things that do not belong to us--namely: credit cards, cash, jewelry, clothing or anything else of value. However, experienced criminal defense attorneys in Michigan would highly recommend resisting the urge to take the property of others. Not only is it illegal, but doing so can bring significant legal consequences including the possibility of a tarnished reputation and time behind bars. Just such an example is the recent case of a Michigan woman who was arrested for property and identity theft after being caught with a stolen credit card and other items.
<h2>Example of Identity and Property Theft</h2>
In early July, Debra Gladish, 54, was dining at a Milford restaurant when the business owner noticed that the credit card she used to pay her tab with was stolen, and she had received cash back to pay for a taxi cab. According to the Michigan State Police, Gladish was carrying three duffel bags with her, full of property stolen from Hartford homes including jewelry, clothing, and purses. Additionally, law enforcement officials have evidence that she pawned much of the jewelry she took at a local shop, making further money off the heist. The evidence against her was sufficient to charge Gladish with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/white-collar-crimes.html" target="_blank">identity fraud charges in Michigan</a>, credit card fraud, and receiving and concealing stolen property.

Gladish was set to appear in Noviâ€™s 52- District Court on July 21st for a preliminary examination hearing. It is unknown how the case will end, as police noted Gladish made statements to them hinting that she may suffer from psychological problems that require rehabilitation.

Even if the jury and judge sympathize with Gladish's potential psychological problems, she will still face several life-changing consequences if convicted of the charges against her. Not only will her reputation be permanently scarred, but it is almost certain that she will spend a significant amount of time in jail. If accused of a crime similar to Debra Gladish, it is important to be pro-active and seek the best legal defense possible for your case. Contacting a hard-working and aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com" target="_blank">criminal defense attorney in Michigan</a> is the first step to ensuring the legal advice and legal representation to properly protect your personal freedoms and liberties.
