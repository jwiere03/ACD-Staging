&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the very first hours of 2015, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/fatal-drug-overdose-prompts-good-samaritan-legislation.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mason Mizwicki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died of a drug overdose. He was at a New Yearâ€™s eve party in Watervliet, MI with friends. They were using drugs. While he lay dying, Mizwicki called out for help. But his friends chose not to assist him. Why? </span><b>Because the teenagers he was with at the time were more afraid of the legal repercussions for themselves, than allowing their friend to die of an overdose.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the heartbreak that followed Mizwicki's death, his parents began lobbying for changes to Michigan's law. Changes that</span><b> would have protected their son's friend's from prosecution, if they had helped him</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Changes that would have saved Mason's life, if only they had already been in place. The result was the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-senate-passes-good-samaritan-bill.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Samaritan Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it took over a year from the time the bill was introduced in December of 2014, until it was finally signed into law just days ago, </span><b>the result is a law that will save lives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When it was introduced, House Bill 4843 proposed that anyone under the age of 21 would have automatic immunity from criminal prosecution in the event that they report a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prescription drug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overdose. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem strange to want to protect underaged drug users from prosecution, but if it means the difference between saving someone's life and leaving them to die, it will be worth it. As Lori Mizwicki said when she testified before the House and the Senate committees, </span><b>the goal is to educate other teenagers about the dangers of drug abuse, but also to protect them if they try to save someone's life.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this particular Good Samaritan law making it onto the books in Michigan, the only other law of its kind was one that protected minors from prosecution in alcohol-related medical emergencies. Now however, </span><b><i>anyone</i></b><b> seeking help for themselves or others for a drug overdose can do so without fear of prosecution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is no age limit. This new statute in Michigan is in addition to other Good Samaritan laws that have been in place for decades in Michigan. They mostly pertain to helping others that are injured. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>No one should have to choose between saving a life and going to jail!</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very big deal, because </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan are no joke, and the penalties are incredibly harsh. </span><b>It is difficult to imagine a teenager, let alone an adult, being willing to risk decades behind bars to save a friend</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who willingly participated in recreational drug use. Very few were tough enough to brave the possible consequences in order to save a life, and now - thank goodness - they don't have to.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, there are different penalties depending on which drug a person is accused of dealing with, and </span><b>whether the charges are for use, possession, distribution, or manufacture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most drug-related crimes are felonies in Michigan, which can mean </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-crime-sentencing.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prison time and very serious fines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those who are convicted.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html#2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Kronzek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a founding partner at the Kronzek Firm, " </span><b>Use of a drug tends to have less severe penalties than Sale or Manufacture.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A classic example of this would be charges related to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/oxycontin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxycontin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/vicodin.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vicodin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where a charge for use is penalized by only one year in jail and a fine of $2,000. However, being charged with manufacture or distribution of either one could land you behind bars from four years all the way up to a life sentence, depending on the quantity in question."</span>
