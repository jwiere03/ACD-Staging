&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused of a sex crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has to be one of the most awful feelings a person can experience. This is especially so if the allegations are untrue, or are based on information that's been twisted and warped to look like something else entirely. </span><b>The natural response is to rush to your own defense </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and try to convince everyone you're not guilty. Wrong move! This is actually the worst thing you could do! Sounds counter-intuitive, doesn't it? Based on our experience, it's not! </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What's the right thing to do in this situation?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are facing </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sex crime charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are some very specific things you should do, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should not do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make sure your case has a chance. </span><b>Saying the wrong thing to the wrong person can cost you your future!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So take a moment to read through our basic list of what you should know, in case you are ever accused of a sex assault crime in Michigan. It may not seem like the most interesting topic now, but if you ever need this information, wouldn't you rather be prepared? Here goes…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Don't say a word to anyone except your attorney!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are going to ask you questions, and it is natural to want to explain and defend yourself. Officers may tell you that if you just help them figure out what happened, they can clear up the issue and you can go back to your life. Sometimes they “just want to give you a chance to explain your side of the story.” Not true. </span><b>The police are not there to help you, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are there to charge somebody with a sexual assault  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The more you talk to them, the more you provide them with ammo they can use against you. It's also possible that they may </span><b>misunderstand or misconstrue something you’ve said</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The best course of action is to politely ask for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and refuse to answer any questions or provide any explanations until we arrive and can advise you. In short, “lawyer up” and don’t believe any of the nonsense the cop feeds you about it making you look guilty or having something to hide. We have represented police officers being charged with sex crimes or other felonies for decades. Most of them do exactly what we advise you to do. Lawyer up; shut up!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Don't fight with the police or resist arrest!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not have committed a crime, or believe that you deserve to be arrested. But even if you're completely innocent, DO NOT RESIST ARREST! Never, ever. You will not win that battle. </span><b>Fighting the police will likely result in additional charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will make the initial charges even harder to address. </span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more compliant and respectful you are, the less opportunities you provide the police with to tack on extra charges or make </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/false-confessions-lie-isnt-actually-lie-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">false accusations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against you. Remember - compliance and respect DO NOT mean you have to answer any questions!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Only provide the most basic information during the booking process!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can tell the police your name and address. After all, this is information they can acquire from your driver's license. If the police ask to see your identification, </span><b>take your fingerprints or a photograph, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">we advise you to comply with those requests. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement officers have the right to do that whether you agree to it or not. However, beyond those biographical basics, </span><b>officers don't need anything else to serve an arrest warrant or book you into a jail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don't fall into the trap of allowing them to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engage you in conversation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even if they tell you they aren't officially questioning you. Everything you say to an officer, even in passing, can become part of the investigative record. Much of the time these days, you are being recorded even if you cannot see a recorder or microphone. This can later be used against you.</span>
