&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time we post an article about wrongful convictions, like yesterday's story about Ledura Watkins, it reopens the discussion among our readers about how easily </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a miscarriage of justice can occur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to current research, </span><b>approximately 10,000 people are wrongfully convicted every year in the United States.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is even more troubling is the fact that a terrifying number of them are juveniles.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Steven A. Drizin, a clinical professor of law at Northwestern University, </span><b>false confessions make up 16% of all known wrongful convictions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Interestingly enough, juvenile's represent a larger percentage of that, with an average of 13% of adult wrongful convictions stemming from false confessions, while for juveniles the number was a much higher 42%.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate study conducted by Gross and others entitled "</span><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rate of false conviction of criminal defendants who are sentenced to death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" also showed that the younger the accused, the more likely they are to falsely confess. Specifically, </span><b>25% of juveniles aged 16 and 17 who were wrongly convicted, were due to false confessions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for juveniles aged 12 to 15, the false confessions rate was much higher, coming in at 69%.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is supported by research done by the </span><a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innocence Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to their data, </span><b>10% of the 329 people exonerated by DNA were arrested as minors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of those juvenile arrests, 94% of them were youths of color. In addition, every one of them was tried as an adult, even though many of them were as young as 14 at the time of their arrest.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Innocence Project believes that there are some very important facts here that cannot be overlooked. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially with regard to this particular demographic. First, 75% of exonerees who were arrested as minors were implicated by other children. Secondly, many of them were accused of committing crimes in large groups. And finally, 84% of the people of color who were arrested as juveniles and later exonerated, were </span><b>arrested due to false confessions and guilt confessions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The facts of the matter are clear. </span><b>Children accused of crimes should be handled very carefully</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and only by trained professionals. Specifically, trained professionals who do not benefit in any way from their confession. While police training is comprehensive, and the law allows an officer a lot of latitude for </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using coercive methods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to gain a confession, this doesn't work with children.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Children are considerably more vulnerable to false confessions due to a host of reasons. Their inability to fully comprehend the implications of a false confession, their lack of developed coping skills for handling stressful situations (like an interrogation), and their youthful suggestibility all </span><b>make them easy targets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for false confession.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many suggestions have been made over the years for how this can be avoided in future. While recent developments in crime solving techniques, like DNA sampling and forensic chemistry, have advanced in leaps and bounds in the last decade or so, we are not out of the woods yet. </span><b>Detailed recordings made of every interaction between officers and suspects would also help as well</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by eliminating issues like accidental contamination of the interview. Criminal defense lawyers all over Michigan see tainted Â interviews daily. Another possible solution is juvenile interviews being conducted by forensic interviewers who are not affiliated with police or prosecutors.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, </span><b>something needs to change, and it needs to change soon</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Children are our greatest resource, and we cannot continue to incarcerate them for crimes they didn't commit. If your son or daughter has been accused of a crime they didn't commit, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact The Kronzek Firm immediately at 866 766 5245</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
