But don't worry - we've got your back here![/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being busted is a scary experience, especially for people who've never been arrested before. If your only experience with the inside of a jail cell is what you've seen in the movies, then </span><b>having the cuffs slapped on you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being delivered to "orange jumpsuit-ville"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be terrifying! </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For people entering the criminal justice system for the first time, every part of the process is scary. The sounds, the smells, the humiliation, the fear. Being </span><b>stripped and searched and photographed and fingerprinted</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of it is new, and all of it is awful. All you want is to go home. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We completely understand that! And if you hire us to represent you during this process, that will become one of our primary goals - to </span><b>get you home as soon as possible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But until then, we want to help ease your fear just a little by explaining some of the process, so that you'll know what to expect.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Your Miranda Rights:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you're being arrested on the side of the road for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drunk driving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in your home for domestic assault, or down at the police station where you were taken for "routine questioning", it will be the same every time. An officer will tell you that you're under arrest, </span><b>put you in handcuffs, and read you your Miranda rights</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, your Miranda rights apply ONLY if you are (a) in custody </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (b) are being questioned. Don’t try to figure out what “custody” means or what “being questioned” means. Lawyers spend years trying to define those terms under Michigan law. </span>

&nbsp;

<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Miranda rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the ones that start out: "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law…." Ultimately you have two Miranda rights that the law protects during and after your arrest - </span><b>your right to remain silent, and your right to an attorney</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (even if you can't afford one.). The most important thing to remember now is: </span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DON'T SAY ANYTHING to the police. Be polite, but do not answer their questions.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do NOT </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consent to a search</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your vehicle, or your home.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call The Kronzek Firm as soon as you are able to. Someone is available 24/7 to help.</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>Booking at the County Jail:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The officers who arrested you will transport you in their vehicle to a local jail where you will be "booked." This means that </span><b>your personal identifying information and information about your arrest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put into the police database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This includes photographing you for the record, taking your fingerprints, and collecting info about you like your full name, current address, and date of birth. You will then be placed into a jail cell. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Your First Court Appearance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first time you appear in court after your arrest will be your arraignment in District Court. You will appear before a District Court Judge or a Magistrate, who will tell you about the charges against you. If you haven't hired an attorney, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/court-appointed-attorneys"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Court might appoint one for you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you are indigent and cannot afford to hire your own lawyer. This is also the time when the judge </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/bail-bonds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sets your bail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as the next court date.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be polite and cooperative with the judge or magistrate. However, do not discuss your case and do not plead guilty. The judge will only ask you about a plea if you are charged with a misdemeanor. ALWAYS plead not guilty. If you are charged with a felony, at this early stage the judge will not ask you about a plea. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The Next Step:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After determining your bond, the judge will set one or two future court dates. Try to remember these dates or write them down. Don’t worry if you can’t. We understand that you’re nervous and afraid. We’ll get that information from the court after we begin to represent you. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step is likely to be an informal conference between the prosecuting attorney and your defense team. It is an important meeting that should be prepared for by your attorney. It gives both sides a chance to talk briefly about the case and where it will be headed. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating the legal system, especially when you have charges against you, is difficult. The odds are almost </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your favor. Why? </span><b>Because the system is stacked in favor of the prosecution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
