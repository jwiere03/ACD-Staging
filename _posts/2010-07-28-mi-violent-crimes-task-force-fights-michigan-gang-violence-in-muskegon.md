Getting into a physical fight with another person can catch any law enforcement official's attention. However, police officers will become instantly more concerned with (and likely to arrest) fight participants if they believe that the individuals are members of a violent street gang. Small towns are not exempt from gang activity! Violent street gangs exist in small and large cities across the country. Ask any experienced criminal defense lawyer in Michigan- - there is the potential that the Courts and Prosecution will look less favorably on a known gang member.
<h2>Gang Violence in Michigan is an Escalating Problem.</h2>
Recently, a fight in Muskegon turned violent resulting in the serious injury of two participants and the death of one. During the investigation, witnesses told law enforcement officials that the gun battle was the result of local gang rivalry. This may not be an unfounded claim. There have been several acts of violence in the area including an attack where a 20 year-old was shot in the stomach and wrist.

Law enforcement officials are still attempting to determine if street gangs are behind the attacks. According to reports from law enforcement officials, they have received several tips from residents and are in the process of following up on those leads. In the mean time, police officers from around the Muskegon area including the Michigan State Police have come together to form a task force, determined to fight against alleged gang activity in local neighborhoods.
