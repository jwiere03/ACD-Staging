An air gun looks much like a actual gun with the exception of the bright orange tip that helps viewers distinguish it from the real thing. And now, according to Michigan's new law which reclassifies the definition of "firearm", it will be easier for people to purchase one. Why? Because Michigan's definition is finally in line with the federal standard.

According to the new law, an air gun is no longer subject to the same regulations that govern real guns. Real guns, you may wonder? Indeed. A gun that uses explosives to fire a bullet, such as a handgun, a rifle or a shotgun, is not the same thing as an air gun, which uses compressed air to fire round plastic pellets.

According to a statement released by Governor Snyder after he signed the bill package into law, "These measures address the confusion that has arisen over Michigan's varying definitions of firearms. The bills were overwhelmingly supported in both the House and Senate, and will give sportsmen and other residents the clarity they have sought on this issue."

<h2>New legislation repeals old law</h2>

In addition, this new legislation also repeals the old law that forbade minors under the age of 18 from carrying a BB gun without an adult present. They also redefined the term "brandishing", and limit local government's ability to regulate air guns beyond the scope of state law.

The National Rifle Association, who was widely in favor of this new legislation, made a statement, claiming that the new legislation will "...relieve Michiganders, and those seeking to engage in interstate commerce with Michigan residents, from outdated and unduly burdensome restraints on the transfer, purchase and possession of most air guns."

However, not everyone was excited by these changes. Senator Steve Bieda claimed that this would be a "recipe for disaster", and cited examples from other states of air guns being mistaken for real guns. An example he noted was of the Cleveland police, who shot a 12-year-old boy who was carrying an airgun with the orange safety tip removed.

We sincerely hope that this new freedom for Michigan residents will be used wisely, and will not lead to tragedy, as Senator Bieda fears.
