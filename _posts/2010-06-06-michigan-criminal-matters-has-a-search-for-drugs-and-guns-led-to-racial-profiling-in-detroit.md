To combat drugs distribution and gun use in Detroit, police officers have increased enforcement targeting heavy crime in downtown hot spots. According to Chief Warren Evans as reported to the Detroit Free Press, that the best way to fight these crimes is to get the illegal ones off the street--especially when one considers that an average of three people are shot there every day.Â  However, critical Civil Rights advocates and concerned Michigan criminal defense attorneys to question the way that police are conducting their searches. Some argue that law enforcement officials are just creating new reasons to racially profile younger black men, ultimately violating their Constitutional rights.
<h2>Detroit Police Face Criticism Over Search Tactics</h2>
For over a year, Detroit law enforcement officials have cruised the streets, keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity. Prior to each shift, patrol officers are given a list of places where current crime activity has been reported. These are the locations that police target first, searching for suspicious looking individuals who are violating minor laws--with probable cause, they will legally be able to interrogate and pat down these people.

However, the Free Press reports that many people are criticizing the techniques police use to search for illegal guns or drugs. Advocacy groups, such as The Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, have spoke out against their methods, rejecting officer's assertions that walking in the street and gathering in a vacant lot is sufficient evidence for a search. Chief Warren Evans was accused of permitting police to be aggressive, using "military-style" tactics toward innocent people.

Even though the Detroit Police Department stands being the task force program, Deputy Mayor Saul Green acknowledged that some changes could be made. In his pledge to "communicate better about the work" he asserted that search techniques used must be within the scope of the law. "There is always the understanding in the process of the unit's work that it has to be done in a way that is constitutional and legal," Green commented.

Although these task forces can be effective in spurring crime downtown, it is important that the rights and personal freedoms of every person is respected, especially by law enforcement officials. In such a situation, aggressive <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/" target="_blank">Michigan criminal defense lawyers</a> would remind you to utilize your Fourth Amendment rights--police must be sanctioned by a warrant from a judge and have probable cause to search and arrest criminal suspects.

Contacting hardworking Michigan criminal attorneys will ensure your case receives not only sound advice and representation, but also superior protection of your personal liberties.
