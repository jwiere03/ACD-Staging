Two Metro Detroit police officers will stand trial for armed robbery.  The incident in question occurred back in July when police sergeants Michael Notoriano and David Pomeroy attempted to retrieve the iPhone of Notoriano’s daughter while off-duty.  The iPhone had been stolen the day before when his daughter was attacked while riding her bike near a Detroit gas station.  Using a locator app, the officers were able to track the phone down and confront the suspects.  With their guns drawn, the officers approached the suspects’ vehicle and seized the phone, $300, a bag of marijuana, and a handgun from the suspects.  It is also alleged that Notoriano used racial slurs and smashed one of the suspects in the face with his gun.


<h2>Defense showed security video that captured the event</h2>

At the preliminary examination, the prosecution passionately condemned the officers’ actions.  Assistant Prosecutor, Kristine Kowal, portrayed the officers as retribution seeking racists abusing the badge in order to solve personal matters.  To combat these allegations, the defense introduced a security video that captured the event.  Notoriano’s Attorney argued that the video evidence did not support the witnesses’ accounts, that Notriano is not seen holding any of the suspects at gunpoint, or robbing them as alleged. Nevertheless, Notoriano and Pomeroy will stand trial.

An Armed Robbery charge is not to be taken lightly.  Armed Robbery is considered a felony that could result in substantial prison time.  In the case of Michael Notoriano and David Pomeroy, they are potentially looking at life in prison.  When the stakes are this high and your freedom or that of a loved one is on the line, you need a lawyer who will fight to preserve your personal liberty.  If you or somebody you know has been charged with such an offense, <a title="Contact us for immediate help" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/contact-us.html">contact us</a> today for a free case evaluation.
