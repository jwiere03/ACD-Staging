&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, we've defended many people accused of cyber crime in Michigan. We understand that the terms </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/computer-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"computer crimes" and "cyber crime"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are ever-evolving, as technology develops and advances with every passing year. If we're going to stay great at what we do, we need to understand and embrace the constant changes. We need to be </span><b>alert and aware of what digital technology offers and how it impacts daily life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/mi-child-pornography-laws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how it enables crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this way, our criminal defense attorneys can defend against these allegations with state of the art information. Together with our experts in computer crimes, The Kronzek Firm is all over this. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, staying alert and informed about cyber crime also means that we know exactly what it entails, and how it can put people at risk. </span><b>Your resources, your finances, even your identity are constantly at risk</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in today's world, as online access threads its way into even the most intimate and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sexting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">private aspects of people's lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With that in mind, we'd like to share our top five tips with our readers about how to stay safe in a world full of cyber-threats.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><b> ALWAYS Protect Your privacy when you're online!</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all internet connections are secure. That is why you should have antivirus and anti-malware software installed on each of your devices. Yes, that includes your tablets and your cell phone. That way, when you're using wifi </span><b>in a public place, like a coffee shop, restaurant, or airport</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your protection software can create a personal VPN and encrypt all of your data to keep your devices and your personal information secure! Wireless hotspots and unknown networks are a huge risk to your security! Use them if you must, but be very careful about transmitting confidential information across them. </span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Remember that phones need protections too!</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people realize that their computers, laptops and tablets need to be protected, but people often forget that their cell phones are susceptible as well! Yet we use our mobile devices for so much more than phone calls these days. If you've ever logged into your bank account with your phone, taken a compromising picture, or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/federal-child-pornography-laws.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">searched online for sensitive material</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you need to realize that </span><b>all the data on your phone is easily compromised</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you don't take the steps to protect yourself. Your best bet is to download a reputable antivirus and anti-malware app that will protect your phone from spyware, malware, viruses, adware, and many other threats.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Not just 'what', but 'who' - Identity theft is real!</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People who haven't been the victims of identity theft simply don't understand how devastating it is! And yet it happens all the time! The 2017 Identity Fraud Study, released by Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, found that in 2016 </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-cancelled-revoked-financial-transaction-device.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$16 billion was stolen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 15.4 million U.S. consumers. Your stolen identity could be used to file fake tax returns in your name, apply for credit cards, or even apply for medical care or loans. In short, your credit could end up trashed! So make the effort to protect your identity from identity thieves - the cost is too high not to!</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h2><b> High-tech devices can put you at risk</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart TVs, smart fridges, hi-tech baby monitors and other "smart home" devices like smart locks and even connected water purifiers were all created to make life easier. However, they can also leave you more exposed. </span><b>All it takes is one compromised smart thermostat, Alexa, baby monitor or a fridge with readily available code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-of-a-computer-to-commit-a-crime-in-michigan-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cybercriminals to infiltrate your network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and access sensitive data. Sounds scary? That's because it is. If you've invested in smart devices for your home, be sure to also invest in tech that protects them from unauthorized access.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Passwords are very important</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, wherever possible, use pin numbers and passwords to protect your information. It may be inconvenient to have to type in a pin every time you pick up your phone, but </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-larceny-attorney-larceny-building-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if your device is ever stolen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the alternative is too horrible to think about! Also, remember to change your passwords regularly, and </span><b>don't use the same password for all of your accounts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Vary it up. Change your passwords every few months, and make sure to use different passwords for your different accounts. It may be inconvenient in the moment, but it can all the difference in the long run!</span>
