<h2><b>It's Road Construction season - a few things to bear in mind</b></h2>
There are a few things that every Michigander can attest to. The wildly fluctuating weather, the chronic allergy issues suffered by pretty much everybody, and the fact that Michigan only has two seasons. Winter and Construction. Well, since winter is now officially over, here are a few things to bear in mind during this next Construction season.<!--more-->

You've all seen the signs on the side of the road among the endless lines of orange cones and heavy equipment. Kill or Injure a worker - Fine: $7500 Jail: 15 years. And it's no joke, folks. This is serious stuff.

In 1999, a young man named Andrew Lefko was paralyzed after being hit by a car while he was working on I-275 in metro Detroit. He suffered a massive brain injury which left him unable to move, speak or eat. The man who hit him served 45 days in jail.

As a result, Michigan legislators passed what is known as Andy's Law. This law created specific penalties for drivers who wreak havoc in construction zones. Injuring a construction worker will get you up to a year in jail. Killing a construction worker can get you 15 years in prison. Add to that the substantial fine of Â $7,500, and you are looking at some very serious penalties.

So what can you do to avoid spending over a decade in prison and emptying out your savings account this construction seasons? Well, it's simple. First and foremost, <strong>SLOW DOWN</strong>! According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, during the busy road construction season, the law requires drivers to slow down to 45 miles per hour on the highway when passing work zones. The only exception to this rule is if there is a construction barrier between the road and the workers.

And should you decide (poorly, we might add) that slowing down is for the birds, here are a few things that may change your mind. Speeding in Michigan construction zones will likely get you a hefty ticket. And we mean hefty - all fines are doubled in construction zones. But that's not all. It also means more points on your license, possible jail time, and steep fines.

Another thing you can do to reduce your risks is to pay attention. Don't text, don't update your Facebook account, don't fiddle with the radio and don't watch your kids in the back seat. Watch the road and pay attention to the signs. Construction zones are clearly marked and you won't miss them if you are alert and paying attention.

And finally, MDOT's Mi Drive app. This handy mobile app provides drivers with real-time traffic and construction information from around the state. Using ITS technology, speed sensors, cameras and even cell phone data, Mi Drive keeps motorists updated with useful information that may affect their travel times and route choices. The app can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTUwNDE2LjQ0MTU3MTExJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE1MDQxNi40NDE1NzExMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE2OTk4ODk0JmVtYWlsaWQ9ZG9sa29AYXVidXJuaGlsbHMub3JnJnVzZXJpZD1kb2xrb0BhdWJ1cm5oaWxscy5vcmcmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;109&amp;&amp;&amp;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mi-drive/id895857036?mt=8&amp;uo=4">iTunes</a> or<a href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTUwNDE2LjQ0MTU3MTExJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE1MDQxNi40NDE1NzExMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE2OTk4ODk0JmVtYWlsaWQ9ZG9sa29AYXVidXJuaGlsbHMub3JnJnVzZXJpZD1kb2xrb0BhdWJ1cm5oaWxscy5vcmcmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;110&amp;&amp;&amp;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.michigan.mdot.mobile.MiDrive"> Google Play</a>.
