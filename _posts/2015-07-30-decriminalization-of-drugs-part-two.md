<h2>Is Decriminalization the Answer to the War on Drugs?</h2>
In the first installment of this series, we discussed the singular and thoroughly unprecedented experiment in drug policy that the Portuguese government has engaged in for the last 16 years. The complete decriminalization of all drugs, without exception. And the surprisingly successful results they have had with regards to decreased drug use and far fewer drug-related deaths. But decriminalization, as it turns out, is only part of the picture. The other part, a vital part, is the social and medical aspect of the program.<!--more-->

Portugal's goal, aside from decriminalization of drug use, was to reduce the stigma attached to it, and provide help. But why would it benefit a nation to reduce the negative associations that attend the use of drugs? Simple. Because people are more likely to seek out help if they don't feel judged for their choices.

Portugal has created a system that promotes prevention and awareness programs, along with rehabilitation for drug users. The rehab centers are funded by the government, in an effort to reduce drug use among the general populace. By making it accessible, affordable and without stigma. But has it really worked?

Portugal still has thousands of drug users among its citizens. Decriminalization has not, technically, been any more successful than criminalization, with regard to eradicating drugs. Certain aspects were definitely reduced, like HIV patients and young adult drug use, but from a "world without drugs" perspective, is decriminalization the answer? And was that even the point?

The war on drugs, certainly, has operated for years under the hope that with enough laws, enough punishment, and enough prison time, people would choose sobriety. But in reality, fear has never been a good motivator. History is overflowing with examples of people who lived in constant fear for their lives, with the threat of extremely harsh punishment for even the smallest infraction, and yet still they broke the law.

The truth is that the Portuguese system never set out to create a "world without drugs". In fact, the system itself accepts that this is not possible, which is one of the sticking points for it's detractors. A "humanistic and pragmatic" approach, as João Goulão calls it. And points out that decriminalization is not the same thing as legalization. Which is an interesting point that most people miss when discussing the Portuguese system.

Around the world, there are currently 25 countries who have embraced some form of drug decriminalization. This number includes the United States, as a growing number of states have embraced either localized decriminalization or even legalization of marijuana. But as of yet, no other country has approached the war on drugs with such a radical, and utterly contrary perspective.

But could it happen? Could America, or any other country for that matter, embrace a system that accepts that drug use is part and parcel of society, and work to reduce the harm to its users instead of sending them off to jail? Most people say no. A few are saying yes. We will have to wait and see.

In Part Three we will be talking about the effect of decriminalization on crime, and what that would look like for the U.S., and Michigan in particular.
