&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a person who's been convicted of a crime, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being sentenced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can seem like a terrifying and rather arbitrary process. As if the judge simply </span><b>picks a large number of years because they don't like you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and want to make your future as miserable as possible. But believe it or not, it doesn't work that way in the Michigan court system. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Michigan judge does have some discretion when choosing a sentence. But they aren't allowed to simply </span><b>pick whatever sentence they think works best</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or whatever number of years suits their fancy. Not without explaining their choices. Since very few judges like to have their decisions questioned or appealed, most of them stay within the state sentencing guidelines. What does this mean? Well, let's break it down…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are 'state sentencing guidelines'?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan there are sentencing </span><b>guidelines for felony convictions that act as advisory suggestions for judges to follow when passing sentence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on people </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convicted of felony crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These guidelines were first released by the Michigan Supreme Court in 1984, and updated again more than once. So what do the advisory sentencing guidelines look like?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's an example: according to Michigan sentencing guidelines, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Production of Methamphetamines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is punishable by up to twenty years in prison. Which means that the law in Michigan allows no more than 20 years in total as a sentence for this crime. However, the judge has discretion to decide the minimum sentence for the felony. A judge could decide on a minimum sentence of 160 months up to a maximum of 240 months in prison. So the maximum sentence is determined by our Michigan criminal law. The minimum sentence is set by the judge using the Michigan Sentencing Guidelines. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What happens if a Judge departs from the sentencing guidelines?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a judge hands down a sentence that departs from the guideline range for those specific charges, without a good explanation, the sentence is subject to a 'reasonableness review'. The appellate court </span><b>determines how reasonable and proportionate the sentence was</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by figuring out whether it violates 'the principle of proportionality". Any upward or downward departure in the felony sentencing must be fully explained and justified by the judge, on the record. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds complex, but all that means is whether or not the sentence is proportional to the seriousness of the crime. In other words, if a Judge hands down a life sentence to someone convicted of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/theft-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Degree Retail Fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which sentencing guidelines say is a 5 year felony), they'll probably have a lot of explaining to do. First Degree Retail Fraud is a felony, but </span><b>the sentencing guidelines suggest no more than five years in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So a judge who sentences a shoplifter to a lifetime behind bars has to explain exactly why they made that choice. The reviewing court then has to determine if the judge made the right decision.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>There are some exceptions to the rules</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentences can be “enhanced” for a number of reasons. For example, having one prior felony conviction on your criminal record will raise the maximum penalty. Having two felony convictions </span><b>raises the maximum sentence even more</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Three or more prior felonies on the defendant’s criminal record sends the sentencing numbers through the roof. Also, prior felonies are not the only way that sentences get ‘enhanced”. .. but more on that another time.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How often do judges deviate from sentencing guidelines in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It certainly isn't a daily event, but it does happen. Sometimes judges </span><b>give a harsher sentence because they believe the defendant deserves it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sometimes they give </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/hyta-sentencing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a more lenient sentence</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">because they believe the case warrants it. Some judges are sticklers for adhering to the guidelines, while others are known for regularly blazing their own trail. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An important point to remember is this: The sentencing guidelines </span><b>do not apply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to misdemeanor convictions in our state. Which is why this discussion has been about felony convictions in Michigan. </span>
