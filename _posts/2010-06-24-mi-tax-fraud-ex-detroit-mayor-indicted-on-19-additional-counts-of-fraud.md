Despite the best efforts of his Michigan criminal defense lawyer, former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was sent to state prison after being convicted of a variety of charges in a 2008 case. However, the problems for the infamous Michigan politician have only begun, as Kilpatrick has been served a federal indictment containing 19 counts of fraud and tax crimes occurring while he was in office.

During his term as Mayor of Detroit, Kilpatrick founded the Civic Fund, a tax-exempt charity designed to improve the city and it’s image. However, on June 23, 2010, the government accused him of taking approximately $640,000 from the fund to pay for a variety of lavish amenities for himself and his family, including cars, expensive clothing, trips, college tuition, and other things. According to the Associated Press, the indictment maintained that Kilpatrick benefited from this fund personally in and out of office, but neglected to report it on five years of tax returns ranging from 2003 to 2008.

<h2>Indictment did not hold that Kilpatrick took bribes</h2>

If convicted of the tax fraud charges against him, Kilpatrick could spend decades behind bars. Fortunately for the ex-mayor, the indictment against him did not hold that Kilpatrick took bribes or kickbacks––surprising considering that federal authorities have sought to pin him with these political corruption charges for years. However, prosecutors and law enforcement officials maintain that the investigation into Detroit-area corruption is ongoing. While it has not been disclosed at this time whether additional charges will be forthcoming against Kilpatrick, it is likely that other indictments will follow, particularly those naming the former mayor’s associates.

As seen by the case of Kwame Kilpatrick, being accused of multiple and reoccurring criminal charges is a difficult process for anyone to go through, regardless of whether they are a public figure or not. Conviction of violations such as tax fraud can have serious consequences, including a tarnished reputation, loss of job, and even jail time.
