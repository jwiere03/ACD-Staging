<span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent study on the LGBT community and the criminal justice system turns out to be very thought-provoking. Â Whatever your opinion may be on the subject, the study is an interesting perspective on something that many people do not think about very much.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, </span><a href="http://www.lgbtmap.org/policy-and-issue-analysis/criminal-justice"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unjust: How the broken criminal justice system fails LGBT people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average LGBT person has a disproportionate number of interactions with the law. Several factors contribute to this including discriminatory policing, biased enforcement, and stigma in the community.</span>

The report also reveals that, while police no longer raid gay bars as they once did, and people aren't thrown in jail simply for "being gay", things haven't changed much otherwise. According to the study, this is most evident in the plight of LGBT people of color, and among LGBT youth.
<h2>Report says LGBT people are faced with considerably more challenges</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The report explains that in addition to LGBT persons being significantly overrepresented in the criminal justice system, they are also more likely to be poorly treated once behind bars. The report says LGBT people are also faced with considerably more challenges than heterosexuals when attempting to put their lives back together after release.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not helped, it seems, by a number of Michigan laws that many say are prejudiced against the LGBT community. For example, Michigan's </span><a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(mvijsihpkleykry5ax4p3dkq))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-333-5210"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HIV-specific law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criminalizes consensual sex without full disclosure, if one party has been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS. Another example is the law that allows private foster care agencies to refuse, on religious grounds, LGBT couples who wish to foster children.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to personalize the impact that injustice has had on lives, the report shares several personal stories of LGBT people who have been adversely affected by the criminal justice system. It also highlights a number of innovative programs and organizations around the country to help them, and change-oriented initiatives that are taking place right now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent media interview, Michigan State Representative Jon Hoadley stated he was glad the report was addressing issues the LGBT community faces when it comes to the criminal justice system. Hoadley is one of only two openly gay legislators in Lansing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of what your opinions are on this particular subject, it is important to understand how all people are affected by the criminal justice system. And to work towards attaining justice for everyone, regardless of their race, creed, nationality or sexual orientation.</span>
