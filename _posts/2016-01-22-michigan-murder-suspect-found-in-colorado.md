<h2><b>Berrien County Michigan Murder</b></h2>
24-year-old Alex Perez, who hails from Los Angeles, is accused of murdering two people here in Michigan, and kidnapping his two daughters. He was recently found in Colorado after a nationwide Amber Alert went out, bearing the description of his truck, and he is now facing the possibility of extradition back to Michigan in order to face charges.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Berrien County Authorities, 27-year-old Renee Mitchell, and her father, 67-year-old John Mitchell, were found dead inside their home recently. But as if that wasn't tragic enough, Renee's two young daughters, who are the biological children of Perez, were missing. Police were alerted when a family member noticed that the house was locked, but a window was wide open.</span>

Using a ladder, the person climbed up to the open window and entered the house, where they immediately discovered the bodies. Shortly after police arrived, they discovered that the 3 and 4-year-old girls, along with Renee's car, were missing, and put out an Amber Alert.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after the Amber Alert was issued, a sheriff's deputy from Clear Creek County in Colorado noticed a parked vehicle matching the description of the missing car in the Amber Alert. Inside the car, which was running, the deputy found Perez and the two little girls. There was a brief struggle, after which Perez was taken into custody and the two children were turned over to the Colorado State Child Protective Services.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police records show that there is evidence to confirm that Perez was in Coloma at the time of the murders. As of now, authorities are seeking to extradite Perez back to Michigan, where he will face charges for two counts of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">first degree murder</a>, and possibly <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-kidnapping-attorneys-michigan-kidnapping-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank">kidnapping charges</a> as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As it stands, there are a lot of unanswered questions in this case, which is under investigation. The investigation is being handled by the Berrien County Sheriff's Office, and the Michigan State Police. They are being assisted by the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office in Colorado.</span>
