&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most car owners think of their vehicles as a convenient way to get around. For some, they also serve as a place to store things, and in a pinch - a place to sleep off a few too many drinks. But not many people think of their cars as </span><b>playing a role in criminal activity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And yet all too often, that's exactly what happens. Not sure what we mean? Check this out this basic break down of a few of the </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/motor-vehicle-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motor vehicle crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan. (And just so you're aware, this list doesn't cover everything!) </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Reckless Driving</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fast and Furious series makes driving like a maniac look very cool. But in real life, </span><b>street racing and other forms of reckless driving</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are nothing more than invitations to your local jail cell. And that's assuming you don't actually </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage any property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or hurt people while you're at it.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone caught driving their car in here in Michigan, in a way that endangers the safety of people or property could be charged with reckless driving. In case you're wondering, that's </span><b>a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days in jail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a fine of up to $500. But if your road stunt causes "serious impairment of a body function" you'll be in a world of hurt!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurt someone in a way that keeps them from living their life in a normal way, and you're looking at a 5 year felony, with fines of up to $5,000. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-manslaughter-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kill someone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anywhere in Michigan with your car while driving recklessly and you're talking about </span><b>a 15 year felony and a $10,000 fine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like we said, serious stuff.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Drunk Driving</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol is probably the most common misuse of a vehicle. Yet despite the fact that </span><b>practically everybody knows what a DUI is</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how much trouble you can get into </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">driving drunk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an astounding number of Michigan residents get arrested for it every year!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So here's a quick refresher - </span><b>Michigan's drunk driving rules are very strict!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are busted driving a car or truck (and that includes a boat, a snowmobile and even a riding lawnmower) with a </span><a href="https://windrunkdriving.com/blood-alcohol-content-dui-testing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blood alcohol count (BAC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of more than .08, you're looking at up to 93 days in jail. Do it again and you're almost guaranteed to spend some time in your county’s jail. Not to mention the fact that you'll lose your license, and maybe even your car!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Leaving the Scene of an Accident</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people think of leaving the scene of an accident as crashing into someone, injuring them, and then </span><b>driving away before the cops arrive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so they don't get into trouble. And it sometimes happens like that. But in MIchigan, leaving the scene of an accident can mean so much more.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you slide on the ice during winter, and </span><b>smack your car into an electrical pole and then leave because no one was hurt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the pole wasn't damaged, you're technically </span><a href="https://windrunkdriving.com/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident-in-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaving the scene of an accident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hard to believe but it's true. This one could earn you 93 days in jail and a big, fat fine.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Injure someone in any way and the stakes get much higher! Under Michigan law, injuring or worse - killing someone with your car and then leaving the scene before the police arrive is a felony! </span><b>Even if you weren't at fault</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the person was harmed or killed by circumstances you couldn't have prevented, leaving the scene is illegal! (And will make everything so much harder for you in the end!)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Fleeing and Eluding</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to leaving the scene of an accident, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fleeing and Eluding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to evading the police in order to avoid getting into trouble. However in this case, it refers to someone in a car who </span><b>willfully refuses to stop for a police officer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is signaling them to pull over. In other words, they kept right on driving when the cops told them not to! That’s just plain stupid. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like numerous other crimes in Michigan, Fleeing and Eluding is divided into categories called "degrees" (think </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sex crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - they're also divided into degrees.) </span><b>The range is pretty big, starting with First Degree Fleeing and Eluding</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where someone is killed in the process (15 year felony) all the way down to Fourth Degree Fleeing and Eluding, which is where the driver turns off their headlights and tries to hide from the cops (2 year felony).</span>
