<h2><b>Open Intoxicant Check Results in Foot Chase and Methamphetamine Charges</b></h2>
For police officers, investigating one thing often leads to other things. Which is why it probably didn't come as too much of a surprise when Port Huron Officers stopped a man for what they thought was an open intoxicant. Only to discover it was an active one-pot meth lab being carried down the street.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident happened at close to 2 am on Sunday morning in Port Huron. An officer noticed a man in the parking lot of a corner business with what appeared to be a bottle of alcohol. The officer approached the man and asked to see what he was carrying, and the man handed the bottle over.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unaware of it's contents, the officer opened it and took a sniff, filling his lungs with toxic chemicals. The man immediately took off running, and the officer pursued him on foot. The man, a 23-year-old, was finally caught some distance away on Gillette street, where he was arrested.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other departments had become involved in the chase, one of which was the Michigan State Police. Somehow, during the course of the pursuit, an MSP patrol car hit a natural gas meter on the side of a house. The Port Huron Fire Department checked it out, before handing the repair work off to workers from SEMCO Energy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was transported to the St. Clair County Jail where he is being held until his arraignment. He has been charged with operating and maintaining a methamphetamine lab, second offense, and might also face charges for possession of methamphetamine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Port Huron Police officer who first stopped him and inhaled the toxic meth fumes from the cooking bottle, was taken to McLaren Port Huron Hospital. Â There he received treated for the inhalation of chemical fumes, and was released.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Michigan law, operating and maintaining a <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">methamphetamine</a> lab is a felony punishable by up to ten years in prison and fines of up to $100,000.</span>
