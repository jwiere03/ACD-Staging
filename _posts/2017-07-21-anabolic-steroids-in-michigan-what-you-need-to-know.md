&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroin, cocaine and prescription meds are drugs you hear about all the time. </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/anabolic-steroids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anabolic steroids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, seem to have taken a backseat in recent years, unless of course you happen to follow professional sports news. Even then, it just isn't a subject that gets a lot of press time anymore. But why not? </span><b>Are people not using steroids anymore?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Or are they not a popular drug these days? Let's take a look.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What are anabolic steroids anyway?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Department of Justice's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), anabolic steroids are defines as "</span><b>synthetically produced variants</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the naturally occurring male hormone testosterone." They are primarily used to help athletes and bodybuilders build larger muscles.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Are steroids still a problem in the US?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes they are, in Michigan and the rest of the country as well. However, they </span><b>aren't considered to be the same threat they once were</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Indications of how low steroids are on the government's agenda can be found in how recently the DEA updated </span><a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/brochures/steroids/professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their anabolic steroids page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - March 2004. The same goes for the </span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/anabolic-steroid-abuse/what-scope-steroid-use-in-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Institute on Drug Abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who last updated their steroids info page in 2006. So as you can see, steroids are no longer treated as a major threat.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the </span><b>lax approach to keeping the public updated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and informed about steroid abuse and its risks, steroid use is still against the law unless it's prescribed by a doctor.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What happens if I use steroids in Michigan?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people use steroids in Michigan. The catch is, are they being used legally? Steroids can be </span><b>prescribed by a doctor to treat a number of conditions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including AIDS, cancer, osteoporosis, anemia and even erectile dysfunction.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who is accused of having, using, or selling steroids in Michigan without a legally obtained prescription will likely </span><b>face severe penalties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Aside from the federal penalties, Michigan law says:</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Use of steroids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and/or a fine of $1,000.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Possession of steroids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days, or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both. Any subsequent violations are felonies punishable by imprisonment for up to 4 years, with possible fines of up to $2,000.00, or both.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Delivery of steroids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a felony. This crime is punishable by a prison sentence of not more than 7 years, or a fine of up to $5,000.00, or both</span></li>
</ul>
