Naked and Afraid. Nope, not the TV show - the real thing! According to police in Clare County, a naked couple were recently apprehended and charged after one of them led police on a high speed chase down the highway, while the other stayed with a child at a rest stop.<!--more-->

At about 4:30 on Tuesday morning, May 5th, Central Dispatch Clare in County was contacted by a concerned citizen. Apparently a driver was going the wrong way on US 127. According to the description given, it was a red Chevrolet Blazer traveling north in the south-bound lanes. Police suspected a drunk driver.

But what they got was distinctly different. The driver, as it turns out, wasn't just drunk, she was also naked. When deputies finally located the vehicle and attempted to stop her, she eluded them. Fleeing down the road, she managed to maneuver around "stop sticks" which are tire deflation devices used by police to end high speed chases.

Finally, the woman stopped the car and fled on foot, however officers were able to apprehend her. She was arrested and that was when officers realized that there was more to the story. Apparently before driving the wrong way down the road, she had left her husband and their child at a nearby rest stop.

<h2>23-year-old Jessie Schwab Devault, and her 32-year-old husband, Joshua Robert Devault, were both arrested and are facing numerous charges.</h2> Jessie is charged with<a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers" target="_blank"> fleeing and eluding police</a>, which is a five year felony, along with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers" target="_blank">child abuse</a>, indecent exposure, and driving while intoxicated with an occupant younger than 16 in the vehicle.

Joshua is charged with indecent exposure and child abuse. CPS was contacted, and the Devault's child was given into the custody of an unnamed person at the scene of the arrest.

After their arrest, Jessie was granted a bail of $20,000, while Joshua was granted a cash bond of $10,000. The judge also authorized blood draws both the couple in order to determine whether or not any drugs were involved. Both Jessie and Joshua are scheduled to appear in the 80th District Court in Harrison, tomorrow, Â May 20th for a probable cause hearing.
