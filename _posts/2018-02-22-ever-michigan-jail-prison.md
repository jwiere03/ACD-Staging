&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As criminal defense attorneys, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we've visited many, many clients in jail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s and prisons all over Michigan. We hear their stories, listen to their fears and concerns, and help to ease the burdens they're facing. However, for all of those occasions "behind bars", we've never had to </span><b>face the challenges of being arrested and booked</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ourselves. But, our criminal defense lawyers have heard stories from hundreds of clients in different counties all over Michigan, including Ingham, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/eaton-county-criminal-defense-attorney-charlotte-michigan-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eaton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/clinton-county-criminal-defense-attorney-st-johns-mi-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ionia, Kent and Oakland. So if you or a loved one are concerned about possible arrest in Michigan, here's what you can expect…</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What will you have to wear while in jail?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you're booked into a jail or prison, you will have your photograph taken, you will be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fingerprinted and searched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and <strong>you will be issued your jail clothing</strong>. Most county jails use one piece jumpsuits that are color coded. Orange jumpsuits usually are for most inmates. Red jumpsuits are often for violent or high security or maximum security prisoners. Green jumpsuits have a different meaning. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prisons are different. Most inmates with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) wear blue pants and a blue shirt that has orange across the shoulders. It is a light, </span><b>relatively shapeless pair of pants and shirt made at a prison from a cotton blend</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You will also be issued a pair of "jail slippers" that do not have laces. Those cannot be given to people behind bars as a safety precaution (Shoelaces have been used by inmates in the past to hang themselves, and to harm others.)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What will you get to eat in jail?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jail food is a source of constant inmate complaints here in Michigan. For years, many Michigan prisons and jails were served by Aramark, a million dollar corporation with a terrible reputation. There were endless </span><b>claims of rotten fruit, meat with maggots in it, and moldy bread</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prisoners received relatively small portions of food that in many cases, inmates claim the person wouldn't feed to their dog. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy caused the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) to end their contract with Aramark early, and instead sign with Trinity Group. The problems, however, didn't end there - Trinity has had <strong>their share of food controversies as well</strong>! Most county jails have their own kitchens and they do not rely on outside vendors. Keeping food costs down is a constant goal for our jails and prisons. They struggle with balancing costs and providing minimum daily nutritional requirements to inmates.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently the state of Michigan is considering returning to state funded prison food, and ending their relationship with private vendors. They hope that will reduce the terrible problems Michigan prisoners and jail inmates have with prison food. But </span><b>don't expect high cuisine at any point.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As an anonymous former inmate </span><a href="https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/what-its-like-to-actually-eat-the-food-in-oakland-county-jail/Content?oid=2354552"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains in his article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Oakland County Jail food, it's usually an endless string of white bread and bologna sandwiches, boiled potatoes, mystery meat and flavorless soups. So set your expectations accordingly.</span>
