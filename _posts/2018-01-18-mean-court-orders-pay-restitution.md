<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-restitution-sentencing-michigan-court-of-appeals-clarifies-calculation-of-criminal-restitution.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don't know what it means, it can be a confusing word, whose pronunciation gives no clue as to what it implies. For those of you who aren't certain of the legal definition here in Michigan, restitution is </span><b>what a defendant sometimes has to pay to compensate a victim</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the  economic losses they suffered as a result of the crime. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Restitution is mandatory in many criminal cases in Michigan.</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, if you commit a crime that causes someone else to lose money, restitution is how you pay them back. In Michigan, restitution is mandatory in all criminal cases where the victim suffers an economic loss. For example, if you </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/home-invasion-breaking-entering.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steal money from someone's car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will be </span><b>required by the court to pay them back the amount that you stole</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example would be items for sale that are shoplifted. If you steal items from a store owner that they were going to sell in their store, you would be required to pay restitution by </span><b>paying them back for the revenue they lost</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This also applies to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damaged or vandalized property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you destroyed property, you would be required to repay its value to the owner.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How does the court figure out what I owe?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The catch in many cases, is how restitution is calculated. According to Michigan law, the amount should be based on the value of the property stolen or damaged by the defendant. So what does that mean? Well, Michigan courts have determined that this means </span><b>the fair market value of the property</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or in other words, "what a ready, willing and able buyer would pay for the property on the open market."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if the alleged victim is </span><b>lying about the value of their property</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">? What happens when someone tells the police that you stole </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than you did, or claims that the value of their damaged property is higher than it really is? The truth is, this happens quite often in Michigan courtrooms. Alleged victims try to capitalize on the opportunity to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-resisting-obstructing-attorneys-resisting-arrest-assaulting-police-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get something for nothing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is why a skilled defense attorney is so important - we fight to stop these lies and help you avoid paying anything more than what you owe!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Restitution can also mean paying medical bills.</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your crime </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused someone else serious harm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they were hospitalized as a result, you may be required to pay for their medical bills. </span><b>If your crime caused someone's death, that too could result in restitution payments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can be a very complicated aspect of the criminal justice system.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, the victims are fairly compensated by their insurance companies, and don't require restitution. This can seem unfair to defendants who are sometimes ordered to pay restitution nonetheless. There are also times when </span><b>insurance companies will pay the victims, and then seek reimbursement directly from the defendant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is complicated subject, and if you have questions about how insurance companies get involved, we recommend you speak to your criminal defense attorney.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Restitution can affect your plea agreement!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, restitution can even affect things like your plea agreement. Many defendants in Michigan agree to a plea agreement without considering how it could affect possible restitution. They </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plead to a lesser crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assuming the court will order a smaller payment, and then </span><b>the judge orders a huge amount instead</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even when the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way to assure that you're not taken advantage of, and that you pay only what you owe and nothing more, is to have a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly experiencled defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your side.
