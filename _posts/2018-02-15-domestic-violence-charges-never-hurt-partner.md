&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Couples fight. It's a fact of life. Put two people together in the same household for any length of time, and they're likely to disagree about something. Usually several "somethings". The issue, though, is how they go about their disagreements. Sometimes it's yelling, sometimes it's the silent treatment, sometimes crying and accusations. But for some couples, a fight involves more. It means </span><b>throwing things, punching the walls, slamming doors, and even putting their hands on each other</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Which is where the cops get involved.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What exactly is domestic violence in Michigan?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan,</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/domestic-assault.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Domestic Violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is considered to be "a pattern of learned behavior in which one person uses </span><b>physical, sexual, and emotional abuse to control a household or family member.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" Not sure exactly who a household or family member includes? Don't worry, many people aren't sure, as the terms can mean many different things to different people. In Michigan, however, a 'household or family member' is defined as:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spouse or former spouse</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person they are, or were dating (here the law defines dating as "frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional involvement")</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person with whom there is a child in common, and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person who lives, or used to live in the same household</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that </span><b>gender DOES NOT play a role in determining who is guilty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of domestic assault in Michigan. A man can abuse either his female or male partner, and a woman can abuse either her male or female partner. Here in Michigan, the most common domestic violence occurs between wife and husband. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>But what if I never laid hands on my partner?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How on earth, you may be wondering, could someone be </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges-michigan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged with domestic assault </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">if they </span><b>never even touched their partner</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? And yet it happens. How? Picture this… </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Lansing couple gets into an argument. They get angrier and angrier, yelling at each other and making accusations. Then one of them reaches the point where they're so mad they want to break something. But </span><b>they know better than to raise a hand to their loved one</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So they punch a wall or a door instead. Or perhaps they fling something through a window, breaking the glass. Now their partner fears for their safety. So they lock themselves in the bathroom and call the </span><a href="https://www.lansingmi.gov/398/Police-Department"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lansing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">police.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Domestic Assault charges can happen even when there was no physical contact!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the cops show up and you get arrested for tossing a clock through the window, or putting your fist through the drywall, you are probably going to be charged with Domestic Violence. Yes, that's right, </span><b>even if you didn't make physical contact with your partner</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All that has to happen is your partner showing the cops where </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-malicious-destruction-property-lawyers-malicious-destruction-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you broke household objects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that fear of physical harm. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They will explain how they felt threatened by you, and were frightened for their life. They may even embroider the truth a little, and accuse you of threatening them, or pushing them. </span><b>There don't need to be any marks on their body</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the prosecutor to file charges! Why? Because in Michigan, domestic assault includes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing a family or household member in fear of physical or mental harm.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causing or attempting to cause physical or mental harm to a family or household member.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging in activity toward a family or household member that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested.</span></li>
</ul>
