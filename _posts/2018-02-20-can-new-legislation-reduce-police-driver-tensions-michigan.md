&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tensions between civilians and police officers are at an all time high right now. </span><b>The break down in public trust in law enforcement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been monumental in recent years. With every officer involved shooting receiving wide media scrutiny, and social media exploding every time </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cops get called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the relations are now so strained, they could snap at any moment. And as everyone knows, a snap is never a good thing. So what can we do about it?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan lawmakers believe they have a plan. A new piece of bipartisan legislation titled "What to do if stopped by blue?" was recently introduced to the State Senate. It's purpose? To facilitate positive </span><b>interactions between Michigan police and law enforcement officers and us civilians during traffic stops</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How on earth does one do that, you may wonder? Let's take a look at the three bill package that was unveiled just days ago in </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lansing-criminal-defense-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lansing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>So what </b><b><i>do</i></b><b> you do if you're stopped by the blue?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal here is to standardize the interactions between police officers, drivers, and any passengers in the car. This way, everyone knows what to expect, what they should and shouldn't say or do, and </span><b>the end result is a much safer interaction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for everyone involved. So what's the plan?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should Senate Bills 805-807 be signed into law, the Secretary of State and Michigan State Police would have to work together to </span><b>develop an interaction program for civilians and cops</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One the program is ready, detailing exactly how an </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">officer/civilian traffic stop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should happen, the guidelines would be included in education curriculums for all future drivers. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secretary of State would also be required to provide a pamphlet including all of this information to drivers 25 and under who are renewing their driver’s license. Another aspect of the program would require all police officers in Michigan to </span><b>carry business cards with them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bearing all of their information, that they can provide to civilians who </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to file complaints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The goal is to keep everyone safe - both cops and civilians!</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar laws were enacted in Virginia last year. Starting on July 1st, 2017, all teens in Virginia taking driver’s ed in public schools will be taught how to properly </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interact with the police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a traffic stop. Before the new law, teens in Virginia were expected to learn how to handle a police interaction </span><b>from their parents, TV shows, and friends</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It's no different here in Michigan.</span>

&nbsp;

<a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/hyta-sentencing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teens all over Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learn how to deal with police, and what you can and can't say to them, from social media, television, and watching their parents. As you can imagine, the results are a recipe for disaster. Lawmakers are hoping this legislation will save lives in the future - both the lives of officers, and the lives of Michigan's young people!</span>
