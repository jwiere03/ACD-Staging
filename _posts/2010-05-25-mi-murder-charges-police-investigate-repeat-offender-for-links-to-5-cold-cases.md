Being convicted of murder charges in any state will result in life-changing consequences. Not only will the accused spend a significant amount of time behind bars, that person's reputation will instantly be ruined--making them a prime suspect should they be linked to any additional homicide instances. Aggressive Michigan criminal defense lawyers see cases like this often, particularly as a repeat offender has a difficult time proving their innocence against charges occurring after conviction. Such are the circumstances of a recent case, as law enforcement officials investigate an ex-convict as a suspect in five cold murder cases.

Nolan George, 67, has an extensive criminal record extending over several years. He was convicted of two strangulation murders, including one occurring in 1968, and the other in 1982. Although both women were pregnant at the time of their deaths, George luckily escaped life in prison for the <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">Michigan homicide charges</a>.

His first conviction for the murder of Francis Brown, 23 years-old in 1968, was overturned after higher courts found some evidence used in court to be inadmissible. For that charge, he eventually pled guilty and served 12 years in jail. After George's release, he was convicted for a second time of homicide for the death of Cindy Rose, 22 years-old in 1982, after she was discovered strangled by panty hose. According to the Detroit Free Press, he again escaped a life sentence after an autopsy revealed that she "died of hypothermia after her unconscious body was thrown along the roadway..." The court ordered him to serve another ten years, eventually being released in 1992.

<h2>Law enforcement officials have not forgotten about George</h2>

Although his prison sentences were completed a number of years ago, law enforcement officials have not forgotten about George. Currently, three states formed an unofficial task force with the mission of solving cold murder cases with possible links to the ex-convict. The Detroit Free Press reports that Michigan prosecutors are reviewing the case of Gwendolyn Perry, who was strangled with panty hose in 1968, along with Delores Blaszcyck, who was found suffocated by her underwear. Although the investigations will take longer to prosecute because they are older cases, these strangulations show a striking resemblance to the murders that George was convicted of. This ultimately prompted him to become a prime suspect in these long-time cold cases.

In total, Midwest Detective Frank Smith believes that George is responsible for seven homicides throughout the region. Investigators hope to gather enough evidence to prosecute him in the additional strangulation cases, but must wait on DNA results to either prove his innocence or guilt.

George is currently in the custody of law enforcement officials after having a confrontation with his landlord last week, who was trying to evict him. Police arrested him for menacing behavior and carrying a concealed weapons, charges that could result in an additional 120 days behind bars.

As seen by the example of Nolan George, being an ex-convict immediately makes a person a target for other homicides in the area, whether or not the suspect was actually involved. Conviction of Michigan murder charges will result in life-changing consequences including prison time.
