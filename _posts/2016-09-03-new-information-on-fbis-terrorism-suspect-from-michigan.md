<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has only been a few weeks since 29-year-old Sebastian Gregerson was arrested for attempting to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/detroit-man-indicted-for-buying-arms-from-undercover-agent.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy illegal arms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from an </span><b>undercover agent posing as a weapons dealer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then,  a lot of information has come to light in that time and FBI documents have revealed some of it to the curious public.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregerson, who calls himself Abdurrahman Bin Mikaayl, was apprehended during an FBI set up where he </span><b>bought five fragmentation grenades from an undercover officer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The grenades, it seems, were to be added to his already </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial weapons cache</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Federal agents that raided his Michigan home later that same day said that Gregerson has a huge stockpile of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felonious-assault-attorneys-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weapons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and survivalist gear.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among his laptops, phones and </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/computer-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">computers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that FBI agents seized from Gregerson's home, the feds also took a great deal of weaponry. Included in the arsenal were </span><b>seven rifles, two AK-47 assault rifles, a shotgun, handguns, thousands of rounds of ammunition and several tactical knives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The knives were apparently similar to those used by Islamic extremists in their beheading videos that are sometimes posted online.</span>

&nbsp;

<h2>Warrant allowed FBI agents to search Gregerson’s home</h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the FBI, the warrant that agents received gave them permission to search Gregerson's home, dig up his yard, and access </span><b>an underground munitions storage container</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No information has been provided on whether or not agents were able to locate the buried </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">munitions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> container that the FBI was convinced Gregerson had.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing </span><b>agents did not find</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they were sure they would uncover during their searches, was </span><b>evidence that Gregerson was providing any form of material support to a foreign terrorist organization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This may be why Gregerson has not been charged with a terrorism related charge. Federal agents have not stopped looking yet.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the course of the 16 month investigation the FBI conducted, during which time an undercover agent met with Gregerson many times, officials say that </span><b>Gregerson spoke in praise of violence and was openly supportive of the terror attacks on Paris and Orlando</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These conversations were always secretly recorded.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another conversation that FBI agents recorded was allegedly one that included </span><b>Gregerson threatening violence against American Muslim Imams</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The conversation allegedly took place in May in a local restaurant, where Gregerson and the undercover agent were meeting.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of local Muslim leaders entered the restaurant and Gregerson recognized them. He then talked to the agent about committing </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-intent-commit-murder-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acts of violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against them and referred to the acts as being akin to "</span><b>shooting fish in a barrell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">." At another meeting, which took place in a park, Gregerson is said to have spotted a park ranger and talked about how best to launch an attack.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the course of the investigation, Gregerson apparently expressed his </span><b>open support for the Islamic State extremists</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a regular basis. He also said that he wanted to move his wife and twin 4-year-old sons to an Islamic State territory and live there permanently.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to David Gelios, special agent in charge of the Detroit field office. "..</span><b>The FBI prioritizes the investigation of terrorist organizations and the homegrown violent extremists that they inspire</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Terrorism is something that requires constant vigilance on the part of the public and routine coordination with all of our public and private partners."</span>
