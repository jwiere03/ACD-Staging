Most prisoner's mail is opened and read thoroughly by prison officials who are looking for any signs of contraband, criminal activity or threats. Which is why it is rather surprising that one inmate from St. Clair County felt that he was safe mailing out a "murder-for-hire" request.<!--more-->

According to the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC), prisoners may send and receive uncensored mail to anyone. The MDOC may not prohibit the contents based on any religious, political, social, or sexual reasons. However, any mail containing information or items that threaten security or violate the law will result in legal action.
<h2>Legal Action for Inmate Request to Have Ex-Girlfriend Killed</h2>
But 28-year-old Michael Christopher Still, who is currently being held at the Ionia Correctional Facility, apparently felt that the risk was worth the possible return. At the time, he was incarcerated for robbery at the Lakeland Correctional Facility, located in Branch County, when officials intercepted the letter. It had been sent out, but was returned to Still at the prison labeled as "undeliverable." It contained his request to a former inmate he had served time with to kill Still's ex-girlfriend.

As a result Still was charged with a single felony count of solicitation of murder. Under Michigan law, this crime is punishable by up to life in prison, or any number of years. For Still, who is currently already in prison, this poses a bit of a problem. In addition, the attorney general’s office has filed a notice that it will supplement Still's charge with fourth time habitual offender status because of his prior criminal record.

In a public statement released by the attorney general's office, Bill Schuette explained that "a murder-for-hire plot would have devastating consequences for the victim and the victim’s family. But thankfully, law enforcement was able to thwart this alleged plan before it could be carried out."

The investigation into the matter was conducted by the Michigan State Police. They, in turn, passed the results on to the Branch County Prosecutor’s Office. However, the Branch County Prosecutor’s Office has requested that the criminal division of the Attorney General's office handle the prosecution of this particular crime.
