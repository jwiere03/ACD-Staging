&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The word "arson" often conjures up images of sneaky men in hoodies, creeping around in the dark with a gas can and a lighter, looking for something to destroy. Or worse, a hardened criminal, who </span><b>uses a raging fire to obliterate the evidence of the murder they just committed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Either way, while these are certainly an option when discussing </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-arson-attorney.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arson as a crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it doesn't begin to cover the realities involved.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan law, the definition of arson is the willful or malicious burning of property. Whether the property belong to</span><b> the person who set it on fire</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or not, it makes no difference in the eyes of the law other than to help the police establish motive. Burning down a building that belong to you is just as illegal as burning down a building that belongs to a complete stranger. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people don't realize that arson isn't charged as a single crime. Much like </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal sexual conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, arson is </span><b>divided into several categories</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, each with their own definition of the crime and separate penalty. Another factor that plays a role in how arson is charged, is the motive. Was the fire set for malicious purposes? Or was the reason financial gain?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>First Degree Arson:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">First Degree Arson includes willfully or maliciously burning or exploding a multi unit building where at least one unit is a dwelling. It makes no difference whether the building is occupied, unoccupied, or vacant. Additionally, </span><b>if the fire results in physical injury to another person</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it also counts as First Degree Arson. Interestingly, burning a mine also falls into this category as well, although this is a very rare instance.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First Degree Arson is a felony under Michigan law, and is punishable by a maximum penalty of life, or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any term of years in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; a fine up to $20,000.00, or </span><b>3 times the value of the property</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (whichever is greater), or both.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Second Degree Arson:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Degree Arson is also a felony in Michigan, and refers to willfully or maliciously burning, damaging, or destroying a dwelling (which means a house or other building that's been adapted for human living), </span><b>regardless of whether it is occupied or not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This also includes </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the contents of a home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or dwelling.   </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Degree Arson, also a felony, is punishable by up to </span><b>20 years in prison</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fine of up to $20,000.00, or 3 times the value of the property (whichever is greater), or both.</span>
