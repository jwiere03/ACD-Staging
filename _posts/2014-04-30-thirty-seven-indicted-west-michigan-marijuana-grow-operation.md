<h2>Michigan’s Medical Marihuana Act no defense in Federal court</h2>
37 people have been indicted as part of an alleged multi-county Michigan marijuana growing operation. Called 'Medical Marijuana Team', or MMT, it was led by a man named Shawn Taylor. Along with his wife Molly, Taylor owned a store in Muskegon called In Do Grow. The store sold equipment for indoor hydroponics and other marijuana growing supplies.

In October 2013, a total of 27 people were arrested in connection with the alleged grow operation. Charges were then dropped in order to continue the investigation. An additional ten suspects have now been charged. Police say the people involved come from many counties in western Michigan— including Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon, Grand Traverse and Oceana. Prosecutors say MMT was using Michigan's <a title="Medical Marihuana Act" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/medical-marijuana.html" target="_blank">Medical Marihuana Act</a> as a ploy to grow marijuana and sell it across the state at a premium price.

According to authorities, MMT held “clinics” in hotels. People would be recruited as patients, and MMT members were named as their caregivers. Authorities also claim doctors connected with MMT have been certifying medical marijuana needs without a physical examination or an existing physician-patient relationship.

Patrick Frederick, a Drug Enforcement Administration task force officer, says that their investigation has found no support for the claim that MMT is only trying to provide marijuana to sick people. Instead it shows that they are just out to make money and abuse the law.

As a result of this investigation, charges were filed in federal court where the Michigan medical marijuana law cannot be used as a defense.

"It was not the intent of the voters that citizens who have lived their entire lives without any contact with the criminal justice system would find themselves in a federal courtroom, deprived of the protections of Michigan’s Act." said attorney Daniel Grow, who represents one of the defendants. Grow also expressed concern that federal resources were being used to deal with something that should have been addressed at a state level.

Authorities found 22 grow operations in multiple cities including Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Kalamazoo, Norton Shores, Grand Haven, Spring Lake and Wyoming. Forfeiture papers have been filed against these properties and also on Taylor’s former home and commercial property. In addition, the Feds are seeking a $1 million judgment representing proceeds of drug sales.
