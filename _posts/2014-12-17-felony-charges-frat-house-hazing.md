Hazing. Just the mention of the word evokes a host of responses, and very few of them are positive. Horror stories abound of hazings gone wrong, victims abused and humiliated and even in certain tragic instances, killed. It is not a nice practice, and in almost every state in the U.S., also illegal.

Here in Michigan, hazing is illegal and, depending on the injuries caused to the victim, can range from a 93 day misdemeanor all the way up to a 15 year felony. But that doesn't stop it from happening, and four students from Saginaw Valley State University have discovered there are consequences.<!--more-->

Trevor D. Hoskins, Laurence D. Dunn, Tevon L. Conrad and Maurice D. Polk Jr., all members of SVSU's Omega Psi Phi fraternity, are all facing criminal charges in connection with an alleged hazing incident that took place at an off-campus location in Carrollton Township.

All four men are charged with single counts of <a title="Michigan Assault Charges and Laws" href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html">assault with intent to commit great bodily harm less than murder</a>, and conspiring to commit assault with intent to commit great bodily harm, which are both 10 year felonies under Michigan's law. Additionally, the four are also charged with misdemeanor counts of hazing causing physical injury, and conspiring to commit a hazing causing physical injury.

<h2>The entire chapter of the schoolâ€™s Omega Psi Phi was immediately suspended</h2>

The four defendants were separately arraigned in the Saginaw County District Court recently, and the entire chapter of the school's Omega Psi Phi was immediately suspended from the university when the charges became public.

Very few details have been released regarding the events that led to the arrests, but officials have said that the felony charges are the result of serious injuries sustained by a 22-year-old man. The misdemeanor charges stem from injuries sustained by a second student who was also involved in the hazing ritual.

Sadly, the ritual abuse that takes place during newcomer initiations is not limited to university "greek" houses, nor is it a new phenomenon. In fact, Liepzig University in Germany, which is one of the oldest universities in the world, formally outlawed freshman hazing practices in 1495. But fraternities and sororities aside, hazing is known to be widely practiced in the military and also for new recruits joining sports teams and careers in rescue and police services.

Hazing methods vary widely from group to group, but certain recurring themes are common throughout. Most notable among these are requirements that the initiates endure sexual assaults, beatings, public humiliation, and torture. Also common is the practice of forcing the new recruit to consume dangerous amounts of alcohol, or to commit a crime.
