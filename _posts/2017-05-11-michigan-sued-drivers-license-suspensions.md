&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine this: You live on a tight budget. You make just enough to pay your bills, feed your kids and put gas in your car. Most months there's nothing left over, so when something unexpected comes up you struggle to make ends meet - </span><b>having to choose between groceries, rent and whatever incidental you couldn't afford to deal with</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like that speeding ticket you got last month when you were rushing to make it to work on time and you got </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulled over</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doing 45 in a 35 zone.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people take the "you do the crime, you do the time" approach when it comes to people who struggle with the consequences of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">breaking the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><b>there are certain instances where the consequences have far greater ramifications for some people than for others</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Specifically, poor people. That’s why the state of Michigan is currently being sued in federal court, claims a plaintiff.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the lawsuit, the Secretary of State is running a scheme that penalizes poor people. The logic behind this accusation is that </span><b>people who are too poor to pay their tickets fees and fines are losing their licenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has a huge impact on their ability to life live. In the words of the lawsuit, this "wealth-based scheme" forces poor people into a "downward spiral" that leaves them in an even worse place than before.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being too poor to pay a ticket means losing your driver's license. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing your driver's license means basic everyday errands like grocery shopping, become exponentially harder. Not to mention the fact that </span><b>getting to and from work becomes more time consuming, as public transport requires a lot more time to cover the same distance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have children that need to be dropped off at daycare before you go to work, this process can be practically impossible.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit is being brought by a Washington DC based civil rights organization named </span><a href="http://equaljusticeunderlaw.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equal Justice Under Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They hope to </span><b>be able to restore driver's licenses to Michigan drivers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who have been unable to drive as a result of being too poor to pay tickets. According to the group the state of Michigan is failing to distinguish between people who are voluntarily refusing to pay their fines, and those who are simply unable to pay. Sometimes that line isn’t so clear. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Equal Justice Under Law argues that this practice violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment, along with the constitutional right to interstate travel. "Although Michigan’s automatic </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-drunk-driving-dui-owi-drug-attorney-lansing-criminal-lawyer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspension of driver’s licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to coerce payment, for people who are unable to pay, Michigan’s practice will never accomplish its intended goal. Michigan has </span><b>trapped Plaintiffs in an inescapable cycle of poverty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by suspending their licenses." </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2010, the Secretary of State </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has suspended more than 100,000 driver’s licenses for nonpayment of fees and fines.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This, however, is not their fault says the Michigan SoS, because </span><b>they are simply complying with state law</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which requires that everyone who fails to pay a ticket is stripped of their driver's license. </span>
