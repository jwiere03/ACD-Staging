&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil asset forfeiture is a subject that brings on very heated debate, particularly in Michigan. People tend to be very against it, or wholeheartedly in favor of it. Wherever you stand on the issue, </span><b>the fact remains that Michigan's civil asset forfeiture laws are in need of an overhaul</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And while it's happening slowly, there are definitely signs of progress.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those signs came in the form of </span><b>a bill signed into law just days ago by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. Our new law prohibits a cash bond requirement in any civil asset forfeiture proceedings.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This change is only one in a long line of civil asset forfeiture reforms that have already started, and will likely continue in the future.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This new law does away with the old requirement that a person whose </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">property has been seized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a civil asset forfeiture case, pay a cash bond before they can challenge the original seizure. Prior to January 3, 2017 a person </span><b>whose assets had been seized by law enforcement had to post bond those same officers who took their belongings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The amount was usually about 10 percent of the value of the items.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been discussing the issues that come with civil asset forfeiture for some time now. In early 2015 we discussed '</span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/civil-forfeiture-law-policing-for-profit.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policing for Profit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">' and </span><b>looked at why Michigan received such a poor grade in the Institute for Justice study</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In July of 2106 we shared with you the stories of people from around Michigan whose homes and lives had been violated by law enforcement during searches, and the losses they suffered as a result of civil asset forfeiture.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of 2015 there was a light at the end of the tunnel...</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<b>A significant bill package was signed into law, bringing serious reform of Michigan's civil asset forfeiture laws</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was now required to disclose all civil asset forfeitures, and also to document seizures with far greater accuracy. In addition, the burden of proof for forfeitures was raised from “a preponderance of the evidence” to “clear and convincing evidence.”</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One look at the news however, and it was easy to believe that nothing had changed. When 2016 rolled around, the media was once again brimming with stories of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/couple-to-lose-their-home-in-michigan-civil-forfeiture.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people losing their homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, their belongings, and their life savings to police raids accompanied by civil forfeitures. </span><b>Was the light at the end of the tunnel nothing more than an oncoming train?</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is no. While progress hasn't happened as quickly as people would have liked it to in Michigan, the reality is that change is underway. </span><b>Our gears of justice grind very slowly, as they say, which means that any kind of meaningful change is going to take time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, this most recent law to make it onto the books is a great start to 2017. We can only hope that the trend continues!</span>
