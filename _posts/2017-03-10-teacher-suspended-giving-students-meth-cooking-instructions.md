&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although this surprising situation took place in Canada and not here in Michigan, it has made headlines all over the US, and so we felt it was important to share with you. According to numerous media outlets, </span><b>a teacher in Ontario distributed very detailed instructions on how to cook and inject </b><span><b>methamphetamines</b> to his eighth grade students.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Delight Greenidge, the mother of a 13-year-old student at Erin Mills Middle School in Mississauga, says that </span><b>her son was given meth cooking instructions by his teacher</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The assignment, handed out in drama class, apparently included clear instructions for cooking <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank">methamphetamine</a>, along with a list of ingredients. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">While this may seem unbelievable, the situation wasn't nearly sinister as it sounds. In fact, it appears to be </span><b>nothing more than a poorly thought out attempt by the teacher in question</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to provide his drama class with a subject to act out in drama class.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Greenidge, she could hardly believe her eyes when she read the assignment.</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">"I’m reading this thing and my eyes are just swelling as I’m reading it and I think my blood pressure went up by about 50 points because it is </span><b>detailed, step-by-step, blueprint instructions on what you need to make crystal meth, how to prepare the crystal meth and then how to inject yourself with crystal meth</b><span style="font-weight: 400">."</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">When discussing the situation with her son, Greenidge says that her son told her that the assignment was given out as a solution to a problem his drama group had in coming up with a subject for their skit. He claims that he and some other class mates were trying to create a skit based on an old TV show, but when that didn't work out, </span><b>his teacher suggested a skit based on meth. </b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher then handed out a list of instructions that included step by step instructions for cooking meth and a concise list of all the ingredients. The teacher then told the drama students to </span><b>"act scared" while cooking the meth, and then "act happy" when injecting it</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The instructions also included details on exactly how to inject the meth once it was cooked, including the line: “Give your arms a wipe with alcohol wipes...or use a wet wipe, this is to prevent any bacterial infection.”</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher has since been suspended while the school district determined what is the right course of action. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Carla Pereira, manager of communications for the Peel District School Board has described the situation as "shocking and inappropriate."</span> <b>It's also not clear how this would be prosecuted, if at all.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Technically this is more a case of poor judgement than it is a case of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-crime-sentencing.html" target="_blank">criminal behavior</a>, as no actual meth was made or dispensed or used.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Chuck Kronzek, a founding partner at The Kronzek Firm, says that ….." In Michigan, the teacher could be charged with a number of crimes ranging from contributing to the delinquency of a minor to aiding and abetting if one of the kids had actually cooked up a pot of meth." Maybe we can all agree that the teacher’s conduct was irresponsible and foolish if not criminal. </span>

&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400">While this is not currently being handled as criminal activity in Canada, there are a great many instances where meth does lead to <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html" target="_blank">criminal charges</a> here in Michigan.
