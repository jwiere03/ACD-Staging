<h2>8 Defendants Charged with Selling Marijuana to Undercover Police Officers</h2>
Last August, the Oakland County Narcotics Enforcement Team raided Clinical Relief, a medical marijuana clinic in Ferndale, Michigan. The officers arrested nine people who had ties to the clinic. The 43<sup>rd</sup> District Judge Joseph Longo recently ruled that there is probable cause that eight of the nine defendants broke the law by selling marijuana to undercover police. The eight defendants will now stand trial on conspiracy charges and drug charges.

The eight remaining defendants include: Anthony Agro, Nicholas Agro, Matthew Curtis, Ryan Richmond, Barbara Agro, Ryan Fleissner, Angela Veseli, and Barbara Johnson. These people face a variety of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/medical-marijuana.html">marijuana drug charges</a>, including manufacturing marijuana, delivering marijuana, possession of marijuana, delivering THC, and conspiracy to commit the listed crimes. Judge Longo dismissed all charges against Stacey Ellenbrook, saying that she only acted as a receptionist at the marijuana clinic and thus did not commit any crimes.

The defendants are claiming protection under the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(fz1cph3sjq5hie55nr01dm45))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-333-26424">Michigan Medical Marihuana Act</a>, passed by voters in 2008. This act allows for the consumption of marijuana by certain people for medicinal use. However, the application of this new medical marijuana law has caused some legal challenges across Michigan. Police raids on medical marijuana dispensaries are becoming more and more common, and Oakland County is no exception. The Oakland County Narcotics Enforcement Team also raided two Waterford businesses last summer, and the defendants from that raid are still waiting for their trials.
