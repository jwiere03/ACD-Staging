<h2>Under the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act:</h2>
<ul>

	<li>It is illegal to publish a list of consumers who supposedly refuse to pay.</li>
	<li>Debt collectors are only allowed to contact you during "convenient" times of day, generally considered to be between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.</li>
	<li>Lastly, should you notify the creditors that you refuse to pay or wish to stop communication, creditors must not engage in any further contact with you.</li>
</ul>
