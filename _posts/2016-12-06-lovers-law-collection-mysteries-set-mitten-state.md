<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan, home to the car capital of the world and birthplace of Motown, is rich with history and culture. </span><b>We boast one of the world's largest suspension bridges, some of the best craft beer in the country, and more miles of beautiful freshwater coastline than any other state in the nation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But did you know that in addition to our many cultural and natural wonders, we're also home to a surprising number of accomplished authors, many of whom do a fantastic job of solving crime and </span><a href="http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dispensing justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the mitten state?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a fan of legal thrillers and mystery stories, then chances are you're already familiar with the works of John Grisham, Michael Connelly, Brad Meltzer, and Scott Turow. But <strong>w</strong></span><b>hat you may not know is that there are lots of wonderful writers right here in Michigan, guaranteed to give you a lot of bang for your buck</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We put our heads together and came up with a short list of our favorites. Enjoy!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Judge Rosemary Aquilina</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet you didn't know that our very own </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/ingham-county-criminal-attorney-lansing-michigan-criminal-defense-lawyer.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingham County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina has penned a fiction novel. A story that accurately depicts mid-Michigan's courts, along with the complex emotions that surround a </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sex-crimes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sex crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> case, this book has received great reviews since it was published in 2003. </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feel-No-Evil-Rosemarie-Aquilina/dp/0972416617" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel No Evil </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">draws the reader in with detailed character development and an intricate plot line full of twists and turns. A good, hard-to-put-down legal drama for your next rainy day!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Loren D. Estleman</b></h2>
<a href="http://www.lorenestleman.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estleman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a prolific writer of detective and Western fiction, was born in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/washtenaw-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Arbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and graduated from Eastern Michigan University. He has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the Shamus Award, The Edgar Award and the Anthony Award. While Estleman writes a number of different series, the ones we love best are the books that center around Michigan-based private investigator, Amos Walker. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker, a fictional detective living and working in the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> area, he claims to "dress like the late show" and likes traditional films and music. With a very brief background in the Detroit </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Department (before being fired for punching someone while in academy), he has an irreverent sense of humor and a quick wit. Readers of Robert Parker's Spenser Series will love this one!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Steve Hamilton</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alex McKnight series, set in Michigan's beautiful Upper Peninsula, is about an ex-cop from Detroit who retires to the U.P. where he rents out cabins to tourists. However, when trouble rears it's head in the town of Paradise, the reluctant investigator steps up. Unhappily, mind you. Known for his bad attitude, sarcasm and fierce loyalty, Alex McKnight is loved the world over by mystery readers.</span>

<a href="http://authorstevehamilton.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamilton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of only two authors to win Mystery Writers of America Edgar Awards for both best novel and best first novel. If you are looking for a good, gripping read that also captures the beauty of Michigan's most remote places, look no further than this series.</span>
