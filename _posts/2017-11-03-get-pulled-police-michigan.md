&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a time where </span><b>the relationship between police officers and civilians is, in many cases, strained. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a difficult time, both for people who have to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-issues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interact with officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and for the officers themselves. And as you can imagine, the result is fear. Many people are afraid of the police, and afraid of what will happen if they're ever forced to interact with a Michigan police officer. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People are also unsure about what to expect, and what they should do in those situations. Because </span><b>fear and uncertainty can sometimes lead people to make terrible impulse decisions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we thought it was important to give our readers a quick breakdown of what to do if you're ever pulled over. A little 'roadside police interaction 101' if you will.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><b> Follow the law</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you notice an officer behind you with lights and/or siren going, </span><b>pull over immediately</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. DO NOT keep driving! DO NOT try to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evade the officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or get away! Simply pull over as quickly and safely as you can.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Reduce risks</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic stops are risky for cops. They're walking up to </span><b>a vehicle that contains unknown variables</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they are trained to be alert to threats. Do you have a gun? Are you </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">under the influence of drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Are you doing something illegal? They have no idea, and so they are usually on high alert as they walk up to your vehicle.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The safest thing you can do is turn off your car, turn on your interior light (if it's dark outside) and put both your hands on the top of your steering wheel. </span><b>None of these actions is legally required</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it goes a long way towards making the officer approaching your car feel less threatened. If they can see your hands, they know you're not armed and that will make YOU a lot safer in the long run.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Be respectful</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not escalate the situation if possible. Be calm, polite and respectful. If the officer asks to see your license and registration, </span><b>get the documents out and hand them over.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the officer asks you to step out of your vehicle, then do so. If they put handcuffs on you and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tell you that you're under arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, do not fight them or try to run away. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now this is important! Are you paying attention? Good. </span><b>DO NOT argue with the police!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DO NOT fight them, try to run away from them, threaten them or try to take their weapons! Nothing good will come of it for you. Almost all people who try to run away from the police at roadside stops are caught. They have search dogs, helicopters, weapons and multiple trained officers at their disposal. You only have you. So unless you want </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional charges against you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be cooperative.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h2><b> Remember your rights</b></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While it's very important to be respectful and polite, that doesn't mean you have to build the prosecution's case for them. Remember your rights! You DO NOT have to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consent to a search</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just because the officer asks you to. You should disregard any threat from the officer that s/he will get a search warrant if you don’t consent to a voluntary search. </span><b>You DO NOT have to answer any questions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they ask you (besides providing identifying information). Remember that you are on opposing teams. If you know anything about sports, then you know that being a cooperative player </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mean scoring goals for the other team. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people think that being cooperative means answering all of the officers questions. They fall into the trap of thinking that if they're helpful to the police that can </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cop-secrets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear up this little misunderstanding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and get back to their lives. WRONG! Being 'helpful' by answering questions and agreeing to a search is </span><b>only helpful TO THE POLICE!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IT is NOT helpful to your case! So after you've expressed your desire for an attorney, keep your mouth shut!</span>
