<span style="font-weight: 400;">The term "</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/financial-fraud-crimes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud Crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" refers to a wide variety of criminal activity, all of which involve some type of fraud. This could refer to </span><b>credit card fraud, health insurance fraud, check fraud, retail fraud and insurance fraud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to name but a few. Because the crimes themselves are varied, and the details change depending on the type of fraud involved, we have decided that it would be helpful to unpack the subject of criminal fraud in Michigan, so that it may be easier to understand.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this series we will pick some of the more common forms of fraud, and explain their legal definitions, along with </span><b>information about how each one is punished after conviction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Let's begin with a very common type of fraud that's actually a daily occurrence here in Michigan… credit card fraud.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is credit card fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The term "credit card fraud," in and of itself, refers to a wide variety of theft and fraud crimes using or involving a payment card. This could mean </span><b>either a credit card or a debit card</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, used as a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/professional-reporting.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fraudulent source of funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a transaction. The purpose would be to purchase goods or services that one couldn't otherwise afford to pay for, or to acquire money from an unauthorized account. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This could mean either that </span><b>the credit card was stolen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the credit card information was stolen (in order to be used instead of the card), or the card was cancelled or revoked. It could also mean using another person’s credit card without their permission. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How do you get charged with credit card fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a law enforcement  believes that you are using, or in possession of, a stolen or cancelled credit card, you are likely to be </span><b>charged with credit card fraud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, in order to prove that you are guilty of this crime, the prosecutor will have to prove certain specific things at the trial. These things are:</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit or debit card was </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/use-cancelled-revoked-financial-transaction-device.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceled or revoked</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The card was issued to an individual, and later canceled or revoked by the issuer</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defendant received notice of the cancellation or revocation</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving notice, the defendant used the device at a business to obtain goods, services, property, etc</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defendant knew the card was cancelled when they used it </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of use, the defendant intended to cheat or defraud someone else</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h2><b>What is the punishment for credit card fraud?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The penalties for credit card fraud vary, </span><b>based on the value</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the items or services purchased, and also on whether or not the defendant has any </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior criminal history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if the value of the services, goods or property is less than $100.00, then the penalties would be:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First offense: this penalty would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to 93 days in jail, a fine up to $500.00, or both. However, if the person has one or more </span><b>prior convictions for the same crime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they could be charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in jail, a fine up to $1,000.00, or both.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the value of the property, goods, or services is between $100.00 and $500.00, a first or second offense would be a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 year in jail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fine up to $1,000.00, or </span><b>3 times the value</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the goods or services, (whichever is greater) or both.</span>

&nbsp;
