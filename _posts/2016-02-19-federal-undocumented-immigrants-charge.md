<h2><b>Novi Restaurateur Charged After Fire Kills Five Undocumented Immigrants</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Roger Tam and his wife, Ada Lei, who live in Novi and own the Chinese restaurant Kim's Garden, are in a lot of trouble for a house fire that killed five undocumented Mexican immigrants. According to police, the couple are now facing federal charges as a result.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It all began when Tam called 911 on January 31st to report that his house was on fire. He told the dispatcher that the fire had started in the basement, but that he had been able to get everyone out of the home in time. He called back seven minutes later to confirm that emergency responders were on their way. But at no point during either conversation did he mention the five people, two of whom were teenagers, who were down in his basement during the fire.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire fighting personnel arrived at the home to find Tam and his teenaged daughter standing in the driveway. It was the daughter who told authorities that there were five young men down in the basement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a later interview with the daughter, she allegedly told officials that the family had lived in the home now destroyed by fire for most of her life. However, they moved to a new home just days before the fire. Â She also apparently said that her father had been bringing home workers from his restaurant for years, and allowing them to live in the basement as a condition of employment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, it was discovered that the five young people were illegal immigrants whom Tam had hired to work in his restaurant. Investigators were able to identify them as Brayan Contreras, 16; Leonel Rodriguez, 18; Simeon Nunez, 18; Miguel Diaz, 23; and Pablo Encino, 23. The fire has been ruled as accidental, and is suspected of being caused by a cigarette, which set fire to a mattress. There were no windows through which to escape, and the smoke alarm had been disabled, making the basement a very hazardous place to live.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tam has been arrested by federal authorities, however his wife has not, as she is hospitalized for an unknown reason. Both will be charged with harboring undocumented immigrants, which could mean up to ten years in prison each if they are convicted.</span>
