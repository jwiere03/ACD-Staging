It is a widely recognized fact that when it comes to narcotics, law makers are usually light years behind their chemistry counterparts in the illicit drug trade. Which is why scientists are calling on lawmakers ahead of time on this one, in the hopes of staying ahead of the curve on this particular drug-in-the-making.<!--more-->

So what is it exactly, and what does it have to do with yeast? Apparently, scientists are working on creating a new strain of yeast that would convert common corn syrup into an opiate through the process of fermentation. The opiate produced would apparently rival codeine or morphine in it's strength.

According to John Dueber, an assistant professor of bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley, this process is only a few years away from being reality. From a medical standpoint, it will be a wonderful way to create less expensive painkillers that are also less addictive and possibly even more effective. In addition, the yeast carries the possibility of being engineered to create a whole variety of other drugs based on the molecules that scientists have derived from natural opiate sources, like poppy flowers.


<h2>Lawmakers hope regulations in effect by the time it hits the market</h2>

But imagine this in the wrong hands. The possibilities are terrifying. Which is why researchers are now reaching out to the National Science foundation and federal lawmakers in the hopes of having regulations in place by the time this product hits the market.

As Kenneth Oye, the director of policy and practices at the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center at MIT in Cambridge, has pointed out, this is rather unusual. In most cases, research is undertaken and the problems that arise as a result are dealt with after they have already happened. In this instance, scientists are asking for a policy that would tightly regulate access to this yeast before it is even a viable product.

According to Oye, there are a number of things that can be done in advance to reduce the chances of someone being able to recreate this particular strain of yeast for use in illegal street drugs.

First, the security around the narcotic producing yeast strains must match that of current prescription painkillers. Second, all DNA synthesis companies should be required to screen orders for DNA sequences to see if any match those of the key sequence needed to recreate the yeast strain. Third, the yeast strains must be chemically engineered to have as little street value as possible. Making them incredibly complex, or "watermarking" them with specifically tailored DNA markers so that law enforcement can more easily identify them are suggestions. And finally, change current narcotics laws to also include any and all yeast-based opiates.

So keep your eyes open - the drug laws may be changing again in the future. And so might the drugs themselves.
