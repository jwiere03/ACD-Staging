&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back and thank you for joining us for this discussion on eyewitness testimony, and whether or not experts believe it's a reliable form of evidence. As we talked about in the </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/eyewitness-testimony-can-really-trust-eyes-part-1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous installment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more and more courts these days are acknowledging the fact that </span><b>eyewitness testimony may not be as infallible as they had previously believed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Judges all over Michigan are beginning to understand the weakness in it. In addition, numerous studies have shown that it simply isn't reliable. The question is "why?" What makes eyewitness testimony such an inconclusive science? Well, the answer is a knotty one, so let's get started…</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever been in a store or at a restaurant, when you suddenly saw someone you know, only to discover that it's a complete stranger and your eyes played a trick on you? It's happened to almost everyone and </span><b>it's a classic sign of how the human mind works</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The reason behind the unreliability of eyewitness testimony, if you want to sum it up in one word, would be 'memory.' </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The human mind is constantly filtering information out of it's surroundings and processing it. However, that process is heavily affected by a huge number of factors that the individual usually isn't even aware of. </span><b>The mood they are in at the time, events that happened earlier that day, what they were thinking about that the time and other things that were happening simultaneously</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of these will affect how the information is received, processed and stored. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, identifications made at </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crime scenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are often affected by the stress the witness may be under at the time. If there is danger, for example, which would induce fear and the witness is under pressure, this will have a huge impact on how information is perceived and stored in the mind. </span><b>Add to that darkness, or noises, or confusion, and the identification gets even more questionable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, studies have shown that positively identifying a person who is unknown to the witness or who is of another race, is even less likely to be reliable.</span>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Unknown people, and people of different races are proven to be even harder to identify</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the mind has stored the information, the way that it is recalled or remembered can also be affected by innumerable outside forces. For example, the way in which an officer questions a witness can have a major influence on how that witness recalls the information. According to a study conducted by the </span><a href="http://www.nasonline.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Academy of Sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entitled "Identifying the Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification" this is frequently an issue. They say that </span><b>Insufficient training, the absence of standard operating procedures, and the presence of actions and statements made at the crime scene</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can intentionally or unintentionally influence eyewitness’ identifications.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers have been known to sometimes </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/police-mistakes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intentionally influence a witness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, using leading questions and suggestive comments, to identify the suspect that they believe is guilty. However, </span><b>even when police officers make their best efforts to remain as impartial as possible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the human mind is easily swayed by even unintentional remarks and specific body language.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innocence Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, "Eyewitness misidentification is the greatest contributing factor to wrongful convictions proven by DNA testing, playing a role in </span><b>more than 70% of convictions overturned through DNA testing nationwide.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" So when you consider the implications of how many eyewitness testimonies have resulted in people being wrongly convicted, it's easy to understand why there is concern about the use of eyewitness testimony during criminal trials. Thankfully our judges in Michigan are realizing that to some extent. </span>

&nbsp;
