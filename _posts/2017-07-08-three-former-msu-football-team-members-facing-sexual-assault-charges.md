&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being accused of sexual assault has serious consequences, even before the trial and possible sentence is passed. In the case of the three former Spartan football players accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a party, </span><b>they have been kicked off the football team, and also dismissed from the university</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even if the charges are later dismissed, or the young men win at trial, their lives have still been unalterably changed.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Defensive end Josh King, wide receiver Donnie Corley, and defensive back Demetric Vance have all been charged with sexual assault. </span><b>King is facing the most serious charges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, namely </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/first-degree-csc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/third-degree-csc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Capturing / Distributing an Image of an Unclothed Person. Corley and Vance are both charged with single counts of Third Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct in Lansing. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident that led to the charges is alleged to have taken place at a party at the University Villa Apartments in East Lansing, during the early morning hours of January 16, 2017. The alleged victim claims that she and King were talking when he suggested that they </span><b>find somewhere quiet to continue their conversation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She says that they went into several rooms before finally finding a bathroom. There </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/aiccsp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">King supposedly attempted to have sex with her.</span></a>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the statement provided to the Michigan State University Police by the alleged victim, she told King that she didn't want to have sex, but he </span><b>forced her to perform oral sex on him</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She told him that she didn't want to do anything else with him, but he allegedly pulled down her pants and forced her to have penetrative sex with him.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, according to the victim, King's two friends Corley and Vance entered the bathroom. The victim says that the pair forced her to perform oral sex on them as well. At that point </span><b>she collapsed on the bathroom floor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the three men left the room immediately. The victim reported the event to the MSU Police and arrest warrants were issued for the arrest of King, Corley and Vance by the Ingham County Prosecuting Attorney.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">King's cell phone was seized by police, and incriminating text conversations were discovered which implicated him and the other two men as well. In addition, it was later discovered that </span><b>King had recorded the entire incident on his phone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The victim told police that she had no idea about the recording. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to police, King initially denied having any contact with the victim, but when police showed him pictures of her he agreed that he had </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sexually-delinquent-person.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaged in sexual contact with her</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a party. Corley and Vance were also questioned by police, and denied having any contact with the victim. However, </span><b>later they both changed their stories</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and admitted receiving oral sex from the victim. Now all three have insisted that the sexual contact was consensual. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexual assault charges are taken very seriously in Michigan, and can have very dire consequences. As you see here, </span><b>a person doesn't even have to be convicted in order to be punished</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
