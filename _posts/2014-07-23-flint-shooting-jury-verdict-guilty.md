<h2>Shots Fired at Two Teen Boys</h2>
James Kenneth Seeley, a 33-year-old resident of Flint, has been found guilty of shooting at two 14-year-old boys outside his house in September 2013.

According to police records, at 7 pm on Sunday, September 29th, officers were dispatched to the scene of a shooting near Arizona Avenue and Lewis Street in Flint. Flint police, Genesee County Sheriff's deputies and Michigan State Police all responded to the alert. They found two young boys, one of whom had been shot in the leg.<!--more-->

With the help of multiple witnesses in the area, police were able to pinpoint the house that the suspect had entered after shooting at the boys. Police executed a warrant and searched the property.

Seeley was arrested and the police confiscated both ammunition and three weapons from his home. The boy was taken to the hospital and treated for his wounds. He was declared to be in good condition by medical staff following some treatment.

Seeley was arraigned in 68th District Court on two counts of assault with intent to murder, one count of felony firearm and one count of felon in possession of a firearm.

The trial began on July 17th in the Genesee County 7th Circuit Court, and wrapped up on July 18th, taking only 2 days. Seeley was convicted of oneÂ count of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-charges.html" target="_blank">assault with intent to cause great bodily harm less than murder</a>, one count of felony firearm, and one count of felon in possession of a firearm.

Under Michigan law, assault with intent to cause great bodily harm less than murder is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000.00, or both. Felony firearm is a 2 year conviction, assuming that this is the first offense. And finally, being a felon in possession of a firearm is also a felony and is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years, or a fine of up to $5,000.00, or both.

Judge Judith A. Fullerton sent Seeley back to the Genesee County Jail following the reading of the jury's verdict. His sentencing has been scheduled for August 18th.
