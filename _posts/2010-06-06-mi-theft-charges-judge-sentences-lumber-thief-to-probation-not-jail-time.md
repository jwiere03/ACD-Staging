Being accused of any criminal violation is a difficult process, that will undoubtedly involve many legal challenges. However, a person will certainly face increased punishments should they become convicted of crimes on more than one occasion. Even if the violations are non-violent or petty, Michigan criminal defense attorneys can attest that the consequences will be increased for a repeat offender. Such an example is seen in recent news, an ex-convict nearly escaped jail time after pleading guilty to stealing lumber and other outdoor home furnishings.

According to law enforcement officials, Ypsilanti resident Robert Wilber, 51, was seen by a witness transporting materials from Mans Lumber and Millwork in stolen company truck to a nearby storage unit. When officers found and chased the truck and its driver around town and back to the lumber business. Allegedly, Wilber jumped out of the moving vehicle, allowing it to strike another company truck, and attempted to escape on foot. However, police quickly apprehended the suspect and arrested him on <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/burglary-crimes.html" target="_blank">Michigan theft charges</a>.


<h2>Wilber has an extensive criminal background</h2>


After conducting some research, investigators quickly discovered that Wilber has an extensive criminal background, all involving theft violations. In the past, he has been convicted of a range of crimes including receiving stolen property, firearms possession, and breaking and entering. Because he is a repeat offender, Wilber could have faced significant jail time for these crimes. However, he narrowly escaped prison after pleading guilty, being sentenced to three years of probation. Nonetheless, he will still have many personal freedoms restricted--not only is Wilber required to pay fines and submit to drug testing, he is also not allowed to leave the state without permission and report to monthly probation meetings.

As seen by the example of Robert Wilber, being accused of multiple crimes can instantly increase the legal and personal consequences against a person. Although he avoided jail time, he must still comply with the rules of the court and terms of his probation, which limit a person's ability to conduct life normally. Because of the severe consequences associated with repeat convictions, it is essential to proactively search for the best defense possible.
