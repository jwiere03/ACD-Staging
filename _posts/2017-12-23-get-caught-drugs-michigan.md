&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The quick answer to that question is "call The Kronzek Firm immediately!" But we figured you wanted a little more than a single sentence. After all, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/drug-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are pretty complicated, even if you break it down. So here goes...</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>If you get caught with marijuana….</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This situation has no "one, simple answer", because there are </span><b>many factors that come into play</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a possible </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, where you were arrested, and how much you had, and how you were transporting it are all important. There are lots of variables in Michigan marijuana law. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain cities in Michigan, like </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/lansing-criminal-defense-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lansing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/kent-county-criminal-attorney-grand-rapids-michigan-criminal-defense-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grand Rapids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/washtenaw-county-criminal-defense-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Arbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/wayne-county-criminal-defense-attorney-michigan-top-lawyer-aggressive-team.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detroit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have decriminalized the use and possession of marijuana in small quantities. This means that if you </span><b>get caught with very small amounts of pot in any of those 14 cities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you'll be issued a ticket, and that's it. However, if you get caught in any other city or town that hasn't decriminalized it, you'll most likely be arrested and charged. It’s important that you understand that weed is still illegal under federal law so that puts every person in Michigan at risk for being charged with a federal crime for possessing pot. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you are a card carrying patient or caregiver, and the marijuana you have with you is </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/medical-marijuana.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In which case, as long as the product is being correctly transported, you have all of the correct documentation with you, and the quantity doesn't exceed state maximums, you should be okay. 'Should be' being the operative word. </span><b>The law is interpreted differently by different officers and county officials</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As we mentioned in the beginning… if you arrested with marijuana, call The Kronzek Firm immediately!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>If you get caught with "hard drugs"...</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it's </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/heroin.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heroin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>there are no exceptions for these drugs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan. They are all illegal under state and federal law. The same goes for if you're caught with crack (a form of cocaine), </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/anabolic-steroids.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steroids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, "</span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/date-rape-drugs.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">date rape drugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" or any other illegal substance in any quantity, you will be arrested. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The charges that follow will depend on how much of the drug you had in your possession, and what the police suspect you were doing with it. </span><b>There are different charges for producing drugs, using drugs, and selling drugs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, the best thing you can do when you're accused of having illegal drugs is call us!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>If you get caught with prescription drugs...</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're caught with a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prescription drug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is legally yours, there shouldn't be any kind of problem. After all, if the drugs are </span><b>legal when prescribed by a doctor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and your name is on the bottle, it's not an issue. This also applies if the prescription was written for a minor who's in your care. Be aware though that driving under the influence of a prescribed drug is illegal here in Michigan. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If however, you have prescription meds in your possession that you have no legal right to have, you could be in a world of trouble. This also applies if the cops can prove that </span><b>the prescription wasn't legally written</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (for example, the doctor's prescription pad was stolen and their signature was faked). In this case the best advice we can give you is the same advice we've been giving you since the beginning - shut up, lawyer up and immediately call us!</span>
