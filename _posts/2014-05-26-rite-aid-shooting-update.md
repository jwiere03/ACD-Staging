<h2>Ricard Taylor Awaiting Competency Evaluation</h2>
Ricard Taylor, <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/gunman-lansing-mi-rite-aid-shooting-arrested.html" target="_blank">the gunman who is accused of the two fatal shootings </a>that caused such shock and grief in both Lansing and East Lansing last week, will be evaluated to determine whether or not he is competent to stand trial.

Taylor appeared via closed circuit video from the Ingham County Jail last week for his pre-hearing conference before Judge Richard Ball. Taylor was apparently upbeat during the hearing, smiling and asking the judge questions.

Ingham County Assistant Prosecutor John Dewane and Taylor's attorney, Keith Watson, have both agreed that an evaluation is necessary. They have agreed to send Taylor to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mdch/1,1607,7-132-2941_4868_4896-14465--,00.html" target="_blank">Michigan Center for Forensic Psychology</a> located in Saline, Michigan.

After the hearing, Watson was questioned by media about whether or not his client has a history of mental health issues. He declined to comment.

As a result of the requested evaluation, the preliminary hearing will be delayed. Watson explained that an evaluation will most likely take more than two weeks to complete. A hearing was scheduled for Friday, May 23rd, in the 54-B District Court. However, Judge Ball has delayed the hearing until the evaluation has been completed.

Taylor is facing seven felony charges including two counts of open murder, two counts of carrying a concealed weapon with unlawful intent, two counts of felony firearm, and one concealed weapon count. The open murder charges stem from the alleged Rite Aid shooting of Michael Addo, a pharmacist at the Rite Aid in Frandor, and Jordan Rogers, who was Taylor's neighbor.

The two shootings, which occurred separately in two different jurisdictions, briefly resulted in the lockdown of multiple schools in both Lansing and East Lansing.
