&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, there are specific procedures that a judge must follow when sentencing  someone who has been found guilty by a jury, or has decided to plead guilty to a crime. According to Michigan Court Rule 6.425, </span><b>the judge must allow each party a chance to address any issues or concerns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they have with information in the presentence report. Also, the judge is required to conduct a sentencing hearing that is consistent with the standards of due process. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan law requires a presentence report in </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all felony cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however some judges also use them in misdemeanor cases too. These reports are </span><b>usually prepared by the county probation department</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are called Presentence Investigation Reports (PSIR). Lawyers and judges often call them “the pre”. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe that your sentencing hearing was conducted unfairly, or </span><b>a mistake was made in your sentence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then you might be able to </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/sentencing-options.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request that your invalid sentence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be corrected or modified. There are certain time limitations you need to be aware of when filing a motion to correct or modify an invalid sentence. There is no time to waste! </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan Court Rules allow both the Prosecuting attorney and the Defense attorney to file a motion requesting the correction or modification of an invalid sentence. However, the Michigan Supreme Court has recently decided that </span><b>the Court cannot act on its own</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">An attorney is needed to start the ball rolling. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that, as of 2017, the Court cannot correct or modify a sentence without a motion from either the prosecutor or the defendant requesting such an action. If a sentencing hearing has already been held, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/getting-dismissals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you have been sentenced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and now you are being called back to Court due to an error the judge made, </span><b>then you need act quickly! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your attorney to file an appropriate motion to correct the sentence. </span>
