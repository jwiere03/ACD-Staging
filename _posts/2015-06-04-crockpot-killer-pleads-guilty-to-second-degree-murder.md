Crockpot users are constantly espousing the many and varied uses of crockpots. And they are certainly versatile, doing everything from cooking soups and stews to melting wax for homemade candles and even dying yarn. But never mentioned in that list of uses is "murder weapon". Which, let's face it, is better for everyone.<!--more-->

But for Tewanna E. Sullivan, a 51-year-old Detroit-area woman, soup and candle making are not the things for which her crockpot will be remembered. Sullivan, who is accused of murdering her friend with a crockpot, has accepted a plea bargain and pled guilty to a charge of <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">second degree murder</a> while mentally ill.

In return, the prosecution has agreed to drop the more serious charge of first degree premeditated murder. With current sentencing guidelines, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, Sullivan faces between 23 and 50 years in prison for aÂ second degree murder conviction. This is opposed to the automatic life sentence she would have received, has she been charged with first degree murder.

The <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/livonia-beating-victim-dies-charges-upgraded-homicide.html">tragic event</a> that led to these charges took place in Livonia on October 22nd of last year. Sullivan was visiting her godfather in McNamara Towers where he lived. But because her friend, Cheryl Livy, lived there too, she stopped by for a visit. The two women apparently got into an argument over presidential politics, which got heated, and resulted in Sullivan beating her friend into a coma with a crockpot.


<h2>Sullivan had been drinking that night</h2>

Sullivan then contacted police to report what had happened, and waited for them to arrive. Neighbors who were present at the time of the arrest told officers that Sullivan had been drinking that night, and was on some kind of medication. But no one knew details.

Sullivan's attorney, John L. McWilliams, has told media sources that his client had a blood alcohol count of .41 at the time of the incident, which is five times higher than Michigan's drunk driving limit. In addition, he pointed out that Sullivan may also be suffering some mental issues resulting from a brain aneurism surgery she underwent back in 2009. Despite that, however, Sullivan was found competent to stand trial in January after undergoing a mental competency exam.

No information has been made available yet regarding her sentencing date for second degree murder.
