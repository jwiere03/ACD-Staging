A squatter is defined as: "a person who settles on land or occupies  property without title, right, or payment of rent." In a case that was  recently decided by the Michigan Court of Appeals, a Detroit area man  met that definition. He owned a home, but he was thrown out of the home  after Hamtramck, Michigan authorities condemned the house for having no  running water or working toilet. It was illegal for the owner or others  to use or occupy the home because it was condemned.

However, one night a neighbor notified the police that someone was  staying in the house. The police arrived at the home to find the  resident / squatter watching television. He invited them into the home  and they found incriminating evidence, include Cocaine and drug paraphernalia. The resident / squatter argued that he had  a right against a warrantless search of his  home based on the 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment. However, the Michigan Court  of Appeals held that squatters have no protection against warrantless  police searches in a home where they live illegally, even if they own  the home. In this case the resident was living in his home unlawfully  since it had been condemned.

Our  defense lawyers fight to defend the Fourth Amendment to the U. S.  Constitution.

Your attorney will  be your advocate in and out of court when it comes to defending you from  criminal charges and violations of your Constitutional rights.
