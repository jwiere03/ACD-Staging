post_excerpt: "After a shooting at an Augusta gas station turned deadly, law enforcement officials have arrested Taequean Morange, 20, on Michigan murder charges.

The legal career of aggressive criminal defense attorneys in Michigan is largely based around representing people accused of a variety of criminal charges. Of that number, a significant part is juvenile cases, involving persons under the age of 21 suspected of criminal violations. The circumstances are similar in a recent case where a 20 year-old Michigan resident charged with murder for his involvement in fatal gas station shootings last week.

Last Thursday, Taequean Moragne, 20, was hit with <a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank">Michigan murder charges</a> following a deadly shooting at a Augusta gas station. According to law enforcement officials, the young man robbed a vehicle from his brother's girlfriend. After that plan did not work out, Moragne hijacked another man's car from a local Meijer and forced him to drive. Although Morange wanted to go to Battle Creek, the driver of the vehicle, Thomas Harris, stopped at a gas station in Augusta. After a brief argument in the car, Morange shot Harris, 47, who ultimately died as a result of his injuries.


<h2>Judge disregarded Morange’s claim and ordered him to jail</h2>

The next day, Moragne was officially charged with murder, carjacking charges, and eight counts of Michigan gun charges. The suspect attempted to interrupt the judge numerous times, attempting to plead insanity. Although the judge disregarded Morange's claim and ordered him to jail, the young man's father has stated to police that his son has a long history of mental health problems. This could certainly be true, given Morange's criminal history. In 2007 and 2009, he pled guilty to various Michigan assault charges, as well as breaking and entering and theft.

Facing murder charges are a difficult experience for anyone to go through, regardless of age or prior criminal convictions. As seen by the example of Taequean Moragne, the consequences of conviction are not only life-changing, they are permanent. Punishment for Michigan murder charges will result in the loss of many personal liberties and freedoms, most notably landing the convicted in jail.
