We explain the basics for you...[/caption]

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We've all wondered it before, while marathoning episodes of </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Call Saul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205802/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Get Away With Murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">… "what does that word even mean?" Well, actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don't wonder that - we already know what all of those strange sounding legal terms mean. However, we realize that </span><b>very few people who aren't attorneys understand what all of that terminology means</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So in the interest of making your TV watching a little less confusing, we've put together a list of some of the more interesting legal terms, whose meanings you may not know. You're welcome.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Prima Facie:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nope, this has nothing to do with prima donnas, or fascists. It's actually a Latin term that means "at first glance" or "on it's face." It's a legal term that refers to a situation where someone looks guilty, whether or not they actually are. Thankfully, the American legal system is setup so that </span><b>even people who "look" guilty are presumed to be innocent until proven otherwise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is very important because looks can be deceiving!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a "prima facie" case would be a wife who was home in Grand Rapids at the time of her husband's </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/homicide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was found at the crime scene, and the neighbors heard an argument between her and her husband hours before. Grand Rapids </span><b>Police would probably assume that she is the guilty party. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, further investigation reveals that the bullet was fired from a gun owned by the husband's disgruntled business partner and he lives somewhere else in Kent County.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Habeas Corpus:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one that gets batted around on legal dramas with regularity, but many people don't have a clue what it means. The direct translation from the original Latin is "You have the body." This may sound a little gross, but </span><b>the body they are referring to in this case is a living person</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not a corpse. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a writ of 'habeas corpus' is presented to a judge, it means that someone has been imprisoned, and the law requires that the person who locked them up must show a legal reason for their imprisonment. Essentially, </span><b>habeas corpus is what keep law enforcement from locking people up without valid reason</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and without making an effort to prove that they are guilty of a crime. Essentially, this “writ” is a challenge to whether the imprisonment is legal. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Pro Se:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a term we think should never be applied to any case. Not if you want the best outcome, that is. Unsure what we mean? Well, Pro Se means "for oneself" or "on one's own behalf" and it is </span><b>applied to people who choose to practice law on their own case. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, this is as foolish as it sounds. However, it happens all the time. Oddly enough, the people that are silly enough to play lawyer with no legal training would never try to play surgeon or dentist on themselves. .</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes also referred to as propria persona, which is abbreviated to "pro per," this term applies to anyone who serves as their own legal counsel during a court proceeding. </span><b>The law is very complex and Michigan courts are very particular </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">about how legal proceedings should be handled. We would never recommend that anyone choose to forgo </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/proven-results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced legal representation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in favor of a DIY approach to Michigan law. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Mens Rea:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Directly translated, this Latin term means "guilty mind," which sounds a lot like a tv show but isn't. In the legal sense, </span><b>mens rea refers to </b><b>the intention or knowledge of wrongdoing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that constitutes part of a crime, as opposed to the action or conduct of the accused. Confused? Don't worry, we'll break it down….</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen it comes to the law, mens rea is an important standard in determining criminal liability for certain crimes. In other words, unless a law says otherwise, the prosecutor has to prove that the defendant was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intentionally</span></i> <a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/felony-information.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">breaking the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to get a conviction. The implication here is that </span><b>if the accused person didn't intend to violate the law, they may not be liable for their actions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is far more complex than it sounds. Bottom line is that a mens rea defense is not often used and not often successful. We recommend that you steer far away from committing a crime and thinking that you will not be held accountable for it by claiming that you didn’t intend to commit the crime. Crimes that have a mens rea element in Michigan are called specific intent crimes. . </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope this brief terminology run down was informative. Next time you're laying around on the couch, guzzling popcorn and watching endless </span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law and Order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> episodes instead of folding the laundry like you're supposed to, at least </span><b>you'll know what's really going on during those court scenes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Again, you're welcome!) </span>
