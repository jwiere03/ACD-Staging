&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us again as we unpack the subject of drug addiction and how we are unlikely to ever overcome it without a major shift in society's perspective. </span><b>Dr Mark Calarco wrote an article on the four key elements that would need to chance in the way we view addiction and addicts, which he labelled "People, Cause, Stigma and Media."</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having taken a closer look at the first three in our previous articles, we are going to dig into the final one, and discuss how this has framed our perspective on </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/prescription-drug-abuse.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for decades. Remember, this is just one perspective on the drug addiction crisis. There are lots of perspectives all over Michigan and the rest of the USA. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The Media:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all four of the key elements that Dr. Calarco named, this one is probably the biggest. Primarily because it has such a major influence on the former three. The media, by definition, includes movies, TV, books, newspapers, social media, websites, </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/blog.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and any other format in which information, ideas and social perspectives are shared among the masses. As such, </span><b>the media has a huge influence on how people perceive situations, circumstances, and even other people</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With regards to how the media frames the issue of </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is usually presented in the format of criminal justice. </span><b>People who use drugs are depicted as criminals. As law breakers who deserve to go to jail.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That view, while it lines up with today's legal stance, does not even begin to address the real problem theorizes Calarco.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the focus is placed squarely on </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/miranda-rights.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, makes people struggling with addiction look like the "bad guys." This is unfortunate, because according to Calarco’s thoughts, </span><b>it pits people against those who wrestle with substance abuse, instead of presenting them as people who need help.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A better perspective would be to address the issue from a medical standpoint, which would illuminate the brain disease that drug use causes, and the way it changes and controls people's mind's.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar issue, that was incorrectly perceived by the public for decades, is </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigans-mental-health-courts-new-face-justice-2.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People with schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder were viewed for a long time as "crazy" or "disturbed." </span><b>Only in recent years has the public perspective begun to shift towards a better understanding of mental illness and behavioral and mood disorders.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This growing awareness has resulted in more and more people receiving the help they need, and a lessening of the stigma that was so firmly rooted in the issue. Calarco thinks this is exactly what we need for </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug abuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Awareness of what drug abuse does to the mind and what the brain disease caused by drug use does to the mind might go a long way towards helping us overcome the stigma</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, it would ensure that a much greater number of addicts receive the help and care that they need. In this, the media would do a great service to society if there was a push towards presenting </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/methamphetamine.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drug addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a more truthful light.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some have long claimed that incarcerating people struggling with substance abuse does nothing to help them overcome their problem. Calarco says addiction is not a "criminal choice," in that a person who is getting high, or </span><a href="http://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-larceny-attorney-larceny-building-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stealing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support a habit, is not making an informed decision with a complete understanding of the consequences. </span><b>Their brain no longer operates the way it was originally wired to, which means that they are no longer able to think clearly about the consequences of their actions.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For this reason, sending them to jail to punish them for what they have done does nothing at all to help their brains heal and overcome the "faulty wiring." If Calarco’s theory is right, it still ignores the deterrent and punishment aspects of jail time. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Calarco thinks that as soon as people come to realize that </span><b>addiction has nothing to do with law enforcement, or "right and wrong"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we will be able to start making strides towards overcoming it. Until then, we have to hope that the media will catch on to what many expert are already realizing, and will begin to present a different, more compassionate, and certainly more accurate view of addiction.</span>
