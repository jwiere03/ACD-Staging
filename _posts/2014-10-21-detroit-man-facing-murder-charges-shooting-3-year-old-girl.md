24-year-old Donnie Everett (who is in no way connected to the well-known baseball star from Clarksville, Tennessee) was arraigned on Monday morning in the 36th District Court in Detroit. He is facing a host of felony charges, including murder charges, for a shooting that injured three people and killed a little girl.<!--more-->

According to police reports, Everett and another person who was given the position of 'getaway driver', pulled up outside a home on the 11090 block of Mogul, on Detroit's east side. At about 3:45 pm, Everett apparently entered the house, armed with a Tec-9 semi-automatic machine gun.

He allegedly opened fire inside the house, injuring 3-year-old Amiracle Williams, along with her 17-year-old sister, her 40-year-old mother, and her 48-year-old father. According to media reports of the incident, the getaway driver was also injured by the gunfire.

The family members were rushed to the hospital in the back of police cars. The teenager and her parents are expected to survive. However, little Amiracle, who was shot in the chest, died shortly after her arrival at the hospital.

<h2>Shootings resulted from disagreement on Facebook</h2>

The argument that apparently sparked this tragic incident was a disagreement on Facebook that took place between Everett and Amiracle's 17-year-old sister. Detroit Police Chief James Craig has referred to it as a "feud". He has declined to provide any more details regarding what the fight may have been about.

According to court documents, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy is charging Everett with first-degree murder, which is a felony punishable by life in prison without the possibility of parole.

In addition, he is facing five counts of assault with intent to commit murder, which is also a felony punishable by any number of years in prison up to a life sentence, along with felony use of a firearm, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.
