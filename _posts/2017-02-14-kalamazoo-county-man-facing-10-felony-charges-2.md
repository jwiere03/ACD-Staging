&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">28-year-old </span><b>Matthew Todd Steppenwolf of Plainwell is facing ten felony charges for a series of violent criminal acts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he is accused of committing. However, if you ask Steppenwolf why he did what he is accused of, he will tell you that he was only doing God's work.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steppenwolf's charges include a wide variety of crimes. He is accused of </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-armed-robbery-attorney.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed Robbery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-carjacking-attorneys-michigan-criminal-defense-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carjacking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-arson-attorney.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Degree Arson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ethnic Intimidation, </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/illegal-discharge-of-a-firearm-in-michigan.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discharge of a Firearm in or at a Building</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-felony-firearm-attorneys-michigan-gun-lawyers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felony Firearm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  These charges are the result of what </span><b>police are calling a "violent crime spree"</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that appears to be Steppenwolf's reaction to mounting problems in his marriage, Public Safety Officer Tim Millard said in his police report.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to police reports, Steppenwolf admitted to police that it started when </span><b>he robbed a Citgo Gas Station in Comstock Township, making off with less than 10 dollars worth of gas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He then went to a house located on East G Avenue in Cooper Township, where he attempted to set the home on fire using kerosene. The reason, he explained to police, was because a woman who lived in that house had injured his mother in a motorcycle accident in September of 2016.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Steppenwolf says that he knew the woman who injured his mother lived in that house because he had </span><b>followed her home after she was released from the jail following the crash</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Police reports from the interview reveal that Steppenwolf simply wanted to "do good" by hurting the insurance company involved in his mother's accident. However, court records show that the family is already suing the insurance company.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He then moved on to a home on Monterey Drive in the city of Kalamazoo, where he </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fired shots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the house with a 20 gauge shotgun. The reason he gave police for why was because he believed that his wife was </span><a href="http://www.midmichigandivorce.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheating on him</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with one of the men living inside the home. </span><b>Residents of that home reported seeing him in a red minivan, watching the home on numerous occasions before the shooting incident</b>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witnesses say that he </span><b>shouted obscenities at the home, fired more shots, and then threw a Molotov cocktail at the house</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Betty Brewer, a resident of the house, <strong>says she was lying in bed when she heard the first gunshots</strong>. She crawled around on the floor, locking the house doors, however she stood up for a moment in her kitchen and as a result, was shot.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the shooting, Steppenwolf admitted to police that he carjacked a woman, also in Kalamazoo. The woman told officers that she tried to fight Steppenwolf, but </span><b>he punched her repeatedly in the face and grabbed the keys to her car out of her hand</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He drove the woman's Chevy Malibu across town before crashing it into a tree.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The police officer who responded to the scene says that Steppenwolf was behaving erratically, and admitted to smoking a "cush" of </span><a href="http://www.acddev.staging.wpengine.com/marijuana.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also apologized to the officer and told him "God is awesome!" Steppenwolf's red minivan was found at the scene of the carjacking. Inside it officers found </span><b>shotgun shells, Steppenwolf's ID, cigarettes, a shotgun and fuel matching that used in the Molotov cocktail.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A preliminary examination has been scheduled for Wednesday, February 15th, to determine whether or not Steppenwolf will be bound over for trial. Until then, </span><b>the judge has ordered that he undergo a psychiatric examination</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will continue to watch this case as it develops and keep you updated with new information.</span>
