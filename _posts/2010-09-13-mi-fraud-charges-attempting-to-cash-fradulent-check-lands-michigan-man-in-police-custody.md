In previous years, tracking fraud schemes has proven to be a challenge for law enforcement officials. However, innovations in technology have allowed investigators to discover and crack down on more white collar crimes, ultimately leading to even more individuals facing life-changing accusations.  Experienced criminal lawyers in Michigan see first hand how detrimental a fraud conviction can be, almost certainly resulting in stiff fines and tough jail sentences. Such an example is seen in the recent case of a Michigan man arrested by police after trying to cash a fraudulent check at several area banks.

On September 2nd, a 29 year-old Canton man entered a Chase Bank in Grand Blanc Township with the intentions of cashing a check. While this is normally a common, everyday process, bank tellers easily discovered that the check was fraudulent and refused to cash it for him. According to the police report, Chase Bank employees proceeded to phone other branches in the area, alerting them that he might attempt to cash the check at their locations.

<h2>Suspect gives up once police point a taser at him</h2>

Only a few hours later, the suspicions of bank officials were confirmed. The same man entered another Chase Bank location in the area and tried to cash the same check. When police approached him, the suspect pushed an officer and ran out of the bank.  After a brief confrontation with police, the man gave up when officials pointed a Taser at him. Law enforcement placed the suspect under arrest and took him to the Grand Blanc County jail, where he is being held on fraud charges in Michigan.

If convicted of the white collar crime of which he is accused, this Canton man will face serious legal and personal consequences. Not only will stiff fines be imposed, but it is also possible that he will receive a lengthy jail sentence.
