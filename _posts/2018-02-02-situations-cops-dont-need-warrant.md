&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you assume that the cops always </span><b>need a warrant to enter someone's home or property</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then we're sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but you're wrong. In reality, cops need a warrant to enter or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/searches.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search a premises</span></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all of the time, but there are a few exceptions. Yes, that's right - even her in Lansing, Grand Rapids and Detroit cops can sometimes enter your house without a warrant! Surprised? Many people are.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>What are your rights as a citizen of the US?</h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to start by pointing out that the 4th Amendment to our U. S. Constitution </span><b>protects all of us from unreasonable search and seizure</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Constitution goes on to detail the required process for the police to get a search warrant. By the way, Michigan’s Constitution has the same requirements as the Constitution of the United States. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are exceptions to the search warrant requirements. Some of these exceptions are called "</span><b>exigent circumstances,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">" and they refer to at least two very specific circumstances. Specifically, when an officer is in "hot pursuit" of a suspect, or there is a "life threatening emergency" that the officer is responding to. For those of you who aren't familiar with these two specific scenarios, here's the break down.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Hot Pursuit:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This term refers to an officer who is in the middle of pursuing a suspect. Imagine this… an officer is in pursuit of </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-bank-robbery-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bank robber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Kent County. The robber, in an effort to </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-fleeing-eluding-attorneys-criminal-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evade police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, crashes their car into a fence and then jumps out of the car and runs. However, they're in a Grand Rapids neighborhood, and so they </span><b>crash through the door of the nearest house and cut through it</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hoping to save time and confuse the pursuing officers.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The police officer who is chasing the bank robber is within his rights to chase the suspect right through that house, despite the fact that he </span><b>didn't have a warrant to enter the house</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because he was in "hot pursuit" of a suspect, he couldn't stand around and wait for the court in Kent County to grant him a warrant to run through the house and keep up with the bank robber.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Emergency Situations:</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when an officer is responding to a 911 call for help, or to a situation where they believe </span><b>someone's life may be in danger</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, if an officer was called to an address in Lansing because someone there called 911 due to a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/assault-intent-commit-murder-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">life threatening emergency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the responding officer could enter without a court order.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way, if an officer </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/firearm-charges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heard gun shots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, screams, or pleas for help coming from a certain house as they passed by, they would </span><b>have the right to enter that home without a warrant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Why? Because someone's life may be in danger, and they don't have to wait on the Ingham County Court to grant them permission.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>What does this mean for you?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if an officer was pursuing a suspect, and that suspect fled right through your window and through your house, the pursuing officer would have the right to follow them right into your home. And if while running through your home, the officer happened to see a </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/cocaine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pile of cocaine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a mirror in the dining room, a person </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-unlawful-imprisonment-attorney-unlawful-imprisonment-defense-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tied to a chair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your bedroom, or </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/michigan-child-abuse-attorneys-abuse-neglect-defense-lawyers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a child with severe bruising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their body, </span><b>they would have the right to stop and investigate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or, more likely, to report what they saw while still in pursuit, so that a different officer is quickly dispatched to your house to investigate.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve detailed a couple of exceptions to the search warrant requirement. These are not a complete list of those exceptions. In short, only a legal expert will understand these exceptions, the exceptions to the exceptions and the nuances that pertain to each of them. This isn’t something to guess at. And our criminal defense attorneys always caution against getting legal advice from your plumber, barber, best friend or car mechanic. Their legal advice is almost always wrong. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Did a cop see something questionable in your home?</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If an officer entered your Michigan home for any reason, and is now investigating you for alleged criminal behavior based on what they saw, </span><b>you need to call The Kronzek Firm immediately at 866 766 5245</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span><b>(1 877-7NoJail) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Only an </span><a href="https://acddev.staging.wpengine.com/trial-attorneys.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experienced criminal defense attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can determine if the police had the right to be in your home at the time or to search your home or car, and if the evidence they've collected against you was legally obtained. Don't wait! The sooner we begin, the sooner we can ensure that your rights are properly protected.          </span>
